Welcome to STAT 107! This document will contain and outline of the course notes throughout the quarter.  Please see the course website for an approximate schedule.  In each of the chapters there will be a list of links, resources, and videos for learning more about an individual topic.  This document will be updated constantly, be sure to check here for periodic updates.  In addition, this document does not serve as a substitute for in class instruction, but more as a guide for the general content we discuss.  Students are still expected to attend every lecture.
