# Regular Expressions


With basic string-manipulation functions, we saw how to do things like split
up entries in a data file which are separated by commas.

```{r}
text = "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish"
strsplit(text,split=",")
```

or by single spaces

```{r}
strsplit(text,split=" ")
```

or even a comma followed by a space

```{r}
strsplit(text,split=", ")
```


But we don’t know how to deal with situations like splitting on a comma,
**optionally** followed by some number of spaces.

Not only is it annoying to have such a simple thing defeat us, it’s an instance
of a much broader class of problems. If we’re trying to extract data from webpages, we may want to get rid of all the formatting instructions buried in the source of the webpage. We might want to extract all the personal names from
a document which are preceded by titles (such as Mr., Ms., Miss, Dr.), without
knowing what those names are, or how long they are. And so forth.

We need a language for telling R about patterns of strings. The most basic such language is that of **regular expressions**. Regular expressions are used to **match** sets of strings. Start with string constants, and build up by allowing "_this_ and then _that_", "either _this_ or _that_", "repeat _this_", etc. These rules get expressed in a **grammar**, with special symbols. 

Every regular expression is a sequence of symbols, which specifies a set of text strings that follow some pattern that — match the regular expression. - Regular expressions are strings and therefore a regexp can be stored in a `character` variable.  This means that regexps can be built up and changed using string-manipulating functions. A valid regular expression must conform to certain rules of grammar; it gets interpreted by the computer as rules for matching certain strings, but not others.

Every string is a valid regexp.  We say "regexp" as short hand for the phrase a ["regular expression as used in R"](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html). `fly` matches end of "fruitfly", "why walk when you can fly" but it does not match "time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana; a banana flies poorly".  

```{r}
fly_phrases = c("fruitfly", 
                "why walk when you can fly", 
                "time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana; a banana flies poorly", 
                "superman flew")

# Returns which elements have the term "fly" 
grep("fly", fly_phrases, value = T)
```

If we did wish to match one regexp OR another regexp we cold use the "|" symbol.  This symbol is used in the same way it was in section  \@ref(operators)


```{r}
# Returns which elements have the term "fly" or "flies" 
grep("fly|flies", fly_phrases, value = T)
```


```{r}
# Returns which elements have the term "fly" or "flies" 
grep("flies|fly", fly_phrases, value = T)
```


```{r}
# Returns which elements have "fly flies" or "time" or "flies"  
grep("time|fruit fly|flies", fly_phrases, value = T)
```


Parentheses are used to create groups. 

```{r}
text_colors = c("Some people say grey", 
         "others say gray,",
         "and both are greatly used")

# Searches for the same thing
grep("gr(e|a)y", text_colors, value = T)
grep("grey|gray", text_colors, value = T)
```


## Ranges, Escaping

A character class is a list of characters enclosed between `[` and `]` which matches any single character in that list. We use these braces in regular expressions to indicate character *ranges*.  For example the regexp `[0123456789]` matches any single digit. 

```{r}
text = c("1 Fish", "2 Fish", "red fish", "blue fish") 

# Any numbers?
grep("[0123456789]", text, value = T)
```


If the first character of the list is the caret ^, then it matches any character *not* in the list. For example, `[^abc]` matches anything *except* the characters a, b or c.

```{r}
# Any letters EXCEPT a, b, c
grep("[^abc]", text, value = T)
```


Another example: `t[aeiou]` matches any two-character sequence in which “t” is followed by a lowercase vowel. 

```{r}
text_baseball = c("Ohhhhh", 
                  "take me out", 
                  "to the ball game")

# Match any two-character sequence in which “t” is followed by a lowercase vowel. 
grep("t[aeiou]",text_baseball, value = T)
```


This system of using ranges is used a lot, and there are certain named classes of characters are predefined, below are some of them. 

 - `[:lower:]` : Lower-case letters, equivalent to `[a-z]`
 - `[:upper:]` : Upper-case letters, equivalent to `[A-Z]`
 - `[:alpha:]` : Alphabetic characters: `[:lower:]` and `[:upper:]`.
 - `[:digit:]` : Digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, equivalent to `[0-9]`
 - `\d` : digit, equivalent to `[:digit:]`
 - `\D` : Non-digit
 - `[:alnum:]` : Alphanumeric characters: `[:alpha:]` and `[:digit:]`.
 - `[:blank:]` : Blank characters: space and tab, and possibly other locale-dependent characters such as non-breaking space.
 - `[:punct:]` : Punctuation characters:
! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.
 - `[:graph:]` : Graphical characters: `[:alnum:]` and `[:punct:]`.
 - `[:space:]` : Space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, space and possibly other locale-dependent characters.
 - `\s` : space 
 - `\S` : not space
 - `\w`: word characters, equivalent to `[[:alnum:]_]` or `[A-z0-9]`.
 - `\W`: not word, equivalent to `[^A-z0-9_]`.

```{r}
# Are any digits in the text?
grep("[[:digit:]]", text, value = T)

# Are any upper case letters in the text?
grep("[[:upper:]]", text, value = T)


# Are any lower case letters in the text?
grep("[[:lower:]]", text, value = T)
```



## Metacharacters 

The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character. Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. However, we also use some of these characters to mean different things in order to match more intricate patterns.  The characters reserved for special meanings (and not simply as characters to match) are called *metacharacters*. Any metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash. The metacharacters in extended regular expressions are . \ | ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ?. 

We already saw `|` and `[]` in action above. Now lets talk about the `.` symbol. This symbol matches any single character. To match strings that have a "." we need to use a backslash. 

```{r}
text = c("There was a monster",
        "Superman flew over there.", 
         "He made it in time.", 
        "Yumm, pancakes!", 
        "MMmm Mmmm they were good...") 

# Looks for every character
grep(".", text, value = T)

# Matches only "."
grep("\\.", text, value = T)
```
## Quantifiers 

Here is a list of some of the metacharacters and some of their features. These are all *quantifiers* and they control how many times the regexp should be matched. The following features all are considered *repetition quantifiers*. 

- `+` : The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
- `*` : The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
- `?` : The preceding item is optional and will be matched at most once.
- `{n}` :  The preceding item is matched exactly "n" times.
- `{n,}` : The preceding item is matched "n" or more times.
- `{n,m}` : The preceding item is matched at least "n" times, but not more than "m" times.

```{r}
# Detect the letter "m"
grep("m", text, value = T)

# Detect the letter "m" exactly one time 
grep("m{1}", text, value = T)
```

If we want to match a regexp exactly `{n}`, `{n,}` or `{n,m}` times then it looks for this sequence consecutively. For example, the following command does not output "He made it in time.", despite this phrase having two "m"s in it. 

```{r}
# Detect the letter "m" exactly two or more times (in a row)
grep("m{2,}", text, value = T)
```


```{r}

# Another example 
text = c("3, 2, 1, GO!",
         "On the count of 3,",
         "Count to 100", 
         "Wish upon 1 star.")

# Detect exactly two digits in a row. 
grep("[[:digit:]]{2}", text, value = T)
```


By default, quantifiers are "greedy" and they match as many repetitions as they can.  Following a quantifier by `?` makes it match as few as possible. 

```{r}
# Only look for one digit then stop.  
# It doesn't matter if there is more. 
grep("[[:digit:]]?", text, value = T)
```


## Anchoring 
Anchoring is used to find regexps at specific locations in a string.  For example, at the beginning or end of a word, or at the beginning or end of a phrase. 

- `$` means a pattern can only match at the end of a line or string
- `^` means (outside of braces) the beginning of a line or string
- `<` and `>` anchor to beginning or ending of words
- `\b` anchors boundary (beginning _or_ ending) of words, `\B` anywhere else


```{r}

# matches elements ending in a lower-case letter or comma
grep("[a-z,]$", text, value = T)

# matches capital letters not at the beginning or ending of a word
grep("\\B[A-Z]", text, value = T)

# Find elements that end with a number 
grep("[[:digit:]]$", text, value = T)

# Find elements that start with a number 
grep("^[[:digit:]]", text, value = T)

# Find elements that have a word that starts or ends with u
grep("\\bu", text, value = T)

# Find elements that have a word that starts or ends with t
grep("\\bt", text, value = T)
```


## Splitting on a Regexp 

We can use regexps in many R functions, we are not limited to just `grep()` and `grepl`. For example, `strsplit()` will take a regexp as its `split` argument. This means we can make splits a string into new strings at each instance of the regexp, just like it would if `split` were a string. 

```{r}
# Load data: 
al2 = readLines("http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/statcomp/14/lectures/04/al2.txt")
al2 = paste(al2, collapse=" ")

# Split words by space
al2.words1 = strsplit(al2, split=" ")

# Lets see what this looks like 
head(sort(table(al2.words1)))
```




```{r}
# Split words by space or by a punctuation symbol 
al2.words2 = strsplit(al2, split="(\\s|[[:punct:]])+")[[1]]
head(sort(table(al2.words2)))
```


Closer examination shows there's still a problem:  "men's" $\rightarrow$ "men", "s". 
To handle possessives: look for any number of white spaces, _or_ at least one punctuation mark followed by at least one space
```{r}
al2.words3 = strsplit(al2, split="\\s+|([[:punct:]]+[[:space:]]+)")[[1]]
head(sort(table(al2.words3)))
```

## Stringr Package

The `stringr` package is one of the many packages that helps with text data. This package also has several vignettes with explanations on the different functions available, and how the package works.  It is thought of as an extension of the standard base R functions.  The `stringr` package is part of the `tidyverse`, but the functions and uses of this package are much more similar to base R then `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. 

Two functions that are particularly helpful is `str_extract()` and `str_extract_all()`. These functions find and isolate particular occurrences of words and phrases. When used with regular expressions this can be very beneficial. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

fly_phrases <- c("fruitfly", 
                "why walk when you can fly", 
                "time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana; a banana flies poorly", 
                "superman flew")

# Returns occurrences of a phrase starting with a space, followed by "fl", 
# and ending with any number of letters (upper or lower case)
fl_occurances <- str_extract_all(fly_phrases, pattern = " fl[[:alpha:]]{1,}")

# Remove white space
fl_occurances <- lapply(fl_occurances, 
                        gsub, 
                        pattern = "[[:space:]]", 
                        replacement = "")
fl_occurances
```



## Wordcloud Package

Another package that is particularly useful for working with text data is the `wordcloud` package.  This package extends the standard Base R plotting, and allows us to build word clouds.  It uses the same general principals and features that we do with Base R. 

Lets use the same Abraham Lincoln speech from the previous section. This time we will remove all punctuation, make everything lower case, and replace all whitepsace with a single space for consistency. 

```{r}
library(wordcloud)

the_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpkgarcia/LearnRBook/main/data_sets/al1.txt"
al1 <- readLines(the_url, warn = FALSE)

# make everything lower case
al1 <- tolower(al1)

# remove puncuation
al1 <- gsub("[[:punct:]]" , "", al1)

# replace any whitespace by a single white space
al1 <- gsub("[[:space:]]", " ", al1)

# see all individual words by spliting by white space
al1.words <- strsplit(al1, " ")

# Word count table 
wc <- table(al1.words)
wc <- sort(wc, decreasing = T)

# Fixed issues from previous section
head(wc, 30)

# The unique words in the table 
names(wc)[1:6]


# Default plot (there is some randomness to how this plot is made, see Help file)
wordcloud(words = names(wc),
          freq = wc) 


# Changing a few settings (Feel free to change more!! :) Have fun with it)
wordcloud(words = names(wc),
          freq = wc, 
          min.freq = 2, 
          random.order = F, 
          colors = c("purple", "blue"))
```



## Example: scanning data files

`grep()` scans a character vector for matches to a regexp  
returns either indices of matches, or matching strings

```
grep(x, pattern, value)
```



[ANSS.csv.html](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/statcomp/14/lectures/05/ANSS.csv.html) catalogs earthquakes of magnitude 6+, 1/1/2002--1/1/2012


```
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>NCEDC_Search_Results</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>Your search parameters are:<ul>
<li>catalog=ANSS
<li>start_time=2002/01/01,00:00:00
<li>end_time=2012/01/01,00:00:00
<li>minimum_magnitude=6.0
<li>maximum_magnitude=10
<li>event_type=E
</ul>
<PRE>
DateTime,Latitude,Longitude,Depth,Magnitude,MagType,NbStations,Gap,Distance,RMS,Source,EventID
2002/01/01 10:39:06.82,-55.2140,-129.0000,10.00,6.00,Mw,78,,,1.07,NEI,2002010140
```

Now we work on extracting *just* the data, not the search parameters and so forth. Notice that every line of *data* begins with a date, YYYY/MM/DD.  We can use this to find just the part of the data that we want. 
```{r}
anss = readLines("http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/statcomp/14/lectures/05/ANSS.csv.html", warn=FALSE)


initial_date = "^[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}"

head(grep(x=anss,pattern=initial_date,value=TRUE))
```


We can also use the `invert` option to find the  *non*-matches. 
```{r}
grep(x=anss,pattern=initial_date,invert=TRUE,value=TRUE)
```

### Match Locations and Substrings 

When you just want a Boolean vector saying where the matches are use `grepl()`. 
```{r}
grepl(x=anss,pattern=initial_date)[1:20]
```


We can also consider the function `regexpr()` which returns location of first match in the target string, plus attributes like length of matching substring. The function `gregexpr()` is similar, but it returns a list of this for all matches. A location of `-1` means no match, and neither returns the *text* of the match


```{r}
x = c("A and B", 
      "A, B and C", 
      "A, B, C and D", 
      "foobar")

pattern = "[[:space:]]*(,|and)[[:space:]]"

# Match data from regexpr()
regexpr(pattern, x)

# Match data from gregexpr()
gregexpr(pattern, x)
```



To getting the matching text we can use `regmatches()` which takes the output of `regexpr()` or `gregexpr()` and a string, and returns the matching strings. 


```{r}
x = c("A and B", 
      "A, B and C", 
      "A, B, C and D", 
      "foobar")

pattern = "[[:space:]]*(,|and)[[:space:]]"

## Match data from regexpr()
m = regexpr(pattern, x)
regmatches(x, m)
regmatches(x, m, invert = TRUE)

## Match data from gregexpr()
m = gregexpr(pattern, x)
regmatches(x, m)
regmatches(x, m, invert = TRUE)
```


Why separate `regexpr()` from `regmatches`? This lets us do things like count the number or length of matches with less work. It also lets us see what text in one file corresponds to matching locations in another file. 
  

Get the (latitude, longitude) pair for each earthquake.
```{r}
one_geo_coord = paste("-?[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{4}")
pair_geo_coords = paste(rep(one_geo_coord,2),collapse=",")
have_coords = grepl(x=anss,pattern=pair_geo_coords)
coord.matches = gregexpr(pattern=pair_geo_coords,text=anss[have_coords])
coords = regmatches(x=anss[have_coords],m=coord.matches)
head(coords)
```

```{r}
coord.matches[1]
```



```{r}
coords =unlist(coords)  # De-list-ify to vector
coord.pairs = strsplit(coords,",")  # Break apart latitude and longitude
coord.df = do.call(rbind, coord.pairs) # De-list-ify to array
coord.df = apply(coord.df,2,as.numeric) # Character to numeric
coord.df = as.data.frame(coord.df)
colnames(coord.df) = c("Latitude","Longitude")
head(coord.df)
```


```{r}
library(maps)
map("world")
points(x=coord.df$Longitude, y=coord.df$Latitude, pch=19, col="red")
```

### Replacements

Assigning to `regmatches()` changes the matched string, just like `substr()`


`sub()` and `gsub()` work like `regexpr()` and `gregexpr()`, but with an extra `replace` argument

`sub()` produces a new string, assigning to `regmatches()` modifies the original one  


Really, assigning to `regmatches()` creates a new string, destroys the old one, and assigns the new string the old name.
