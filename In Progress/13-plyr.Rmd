## Tidyverse and plyr

For this document you will need to install and load the family the package plyr functions. To install the package refer to Section \@ref(packages). 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=F}
library(plyr)
```


The tidyverse is a collection of packages that share a unique underlying philosophy, frame work, and syntax.  There are approximately 20 tidyverse packages, but the core ones are `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats`.  You can install these packages individually or all at once using by simply using the command `install.packages("tidyverse")`. 

We will be focusing on the `plyr` package for now. The functions and topics that we that we will be covering can be found in @wickham2011split. 


## Iteration with plyr

The main focus of the `plyr` package is to formalize cleaning, and implementing functions to our data sets.  In many data sets we have to split the data into the desired subsets, apply a function, and then reformat the data with adjustments.  This process appears over and over again.  When we apply or implement a function to different components of a data set we typically use an apply method or for loops, Sections  \@ref(apply) and \@ref(loops) respectively. Often times this can take several lines of code to accomplish. 

The `plyr` package aims to reduce the amount of steps it takes to accomplish these tasks. In general, the functions in the `plyr` package are considered iteration techniques and are closely related to the apply functions in base R.  In some cases, a `plyr` preforms exactly the same as the apply functions, both in terms of efficiency and in the task accomplished. 

Although the `plyr` package contains similar functions to base R, some users find this `plyr` functions to be more intuitive. In addition, the `plyr` functions generally have more features and can simplify code. The techniques in the `plyr` package are known as the `split-apply-combine` method.  They work to split a data set in the desired way, apply the desired function, and combine and return the desired output to the user all in one step. This philosophy of the `plyr` functions is inspired by Google's `map-reduce` technique of analyzing their data sets. 

## Syntax

For the `plyr` package an ***a*rray** includes the special cases of vectors (1d arrays) and matrices (2d arrays). Arrays are made out of any atomic vector: logical, character, integer, or numeric. A ***l*ist** is a non-atomic array, which is is an array that can contain any type of data structure. A ***d*ata frame** is a 2d array where each column can be a different atomic class. 

The functions of the `plyr` package have the same general structure:  ?\*ply(). All `plyr` functions have simple and informative names, the first (?) and second (\*) characters describe the input and output data types, respectively.  Several inputs and outputs are supported: a = array, d = data frame, l = list, and \_ = discarded. 

- first character (input type): a, d, l
- second character (output type): a, d, l, \_ (nothing)

A table of the 12 core functions is directly below. 

```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr12corefunctions.png")
```

Similarly to the apply functions, the functions have two or three main arguments depending on the input. 

- `a*ply(.data, .margins, .fun, ...)`

- `d*ply(.data, .variables, .fun, ...)`

- `l*ply(.data, .fun, ...)`

The first argument `.data` contains the object that will be split, processed, and recombined.  The second argument `.variables` or `.margins` describes how to split up the input into pieces. The third argument `.fun` is the processing function that is to be applied to each piece. 

The tidyverse uses function arguments to start with a "." in order to differentiate the `plyr` arguments with any arguments to be passed to the processing function (`.fun`). 

In general, the `plyr` functions have a very similar set up to the apply functions in base R.  Recall `apply(ARRAY, MARGIN, FUN)`. 

## Inputs

Each input type has various rules for how to split it up. 

- Arrays are sliced by dimension into lower-dimensional pieces. 

- Data frames are subsetted by combinations of variables

- Each element of a list is separated. 

The way each input is split up actually doesn't depend on the class of the data object, but the method that it responds to.  For example, an object split using `a*ply()` must respond to `dim()` and accept multidimensional indexing.  Thus, you can use a data frame as a data input for `a*ply()`.  For `d*ply()`, the data must work with `split()` and must be able to be converted into a list.  Hence, many matrix objects can be used as inputs for `d*ply()`.  For `l*ply()` the data must work with `length()` and `[[` indexing. 

### Input: a*ply() 

For the `a*ply()` functions we have `.margins` argument which works the same as the `MARGIN` argument for `apply()`.  

- `.margins=1`: Slice up into rows. 
- `.margins=2`: Slice up into columns. 
- `.margins=c(1,2)`: Slice up into individual cells. 

```{r}

my_mat = matrix(1:100, nrow = 10)
my_mat
aaply(my_mat, 2, mean)
```

### Input: d*ply()

When using a data frame we typically want to split the data into groups based on combinations of variables.  We can do this using the `.variables` argument. This argument supports multiple forms of input. We can use a character vector of column names, `c("Var1", "Var2")` or use `.(var1, var2)`. 

For example, to find the number of observations that have the same `vs` and `am` in the mtcars data set, we can use the following commands

```{r}
daply(mtcars, .variables = c("vs", "am"), .fun = nrow)

daply(mtcars, .variables = .(vs, am), .fun = nrow)
```
### Input: l*ply()

Lists do not have an additional argument to break up the data. The function is simply applied to each element of the list. 

```{r}
# Input: List, Output: Matrix(array)
laply(1:10, rep, times = 4)

# Input: list, Output: list 
llply(1:10, rep, times = 4)
```


## Outputs

The output type defines how the data is recombined after the processing function, and how the data is labeled. 

## Helpers

The `plyr` package has several different "helper" features that are common for data analysis problems. 

- `arrange`: re-order the rows of a data frame by specifying the columns to order by

- `mutate`: add new columns or modifying existing columns, like `transform`, but new columns can refer to other columns that you just created.

- `summarise`: like `mutate` but create a new data frame, not preserving any columns in the old data frame.

- `join` : an adapation of merge which is more similar to SQL, and has a much faster implementation if you only want to find the first match.

- `colwise`: make any function work colwise on a dataframe

- `count`: quickly count unique combinations and return return as a data frame.

- `failwith`: sets a default value to return if the function throws an error. For example, `failwith(NA, f)` will return an `NA` whenever `f` throws an error.
The

- `progress`: allows you to monitor the progress of long running operations. There four different options: 

    + "none", the default, no progress bar is displayed 
        
    + "text", provides a textual progress bar.
        
    + "win" and "tk" provide graphical progress bars for


## Examples 

We will use the `baseball` data set in the `plyr` package. 


```{r}
head(baseball)
```
What we will explore is the performance of a batter over his career. 

### Creating New Columns in a Data Set {-}

To get started, we need to calculate the “career year”, i.e. the number of years since the player started playing. 

```{r}
baseball = ddply(baseball, .(id),
                 cyear = year - min(year) + 1)
head(baseball)
```

Find the number of total home runs for each year, append it to the existing data set. 

```{r}
hr_total_year = ddply(baseball,            # Starting data set 
                      "year",              # How to break up the data set
                      transform,           # Make a new column to original data set
                      total.hr = sum(hr))  # New column is the total num of home runs in a year. 
head(hr_total_year)
```

Add several new columns to a data set with the `mutate` option. 

```{r}
add_columns = ddply(baseball,       # inputted data set
                    "year",         # How to split data
                    mutate,         # Want original data set with (1+) new columns
                    mu = mean(hr),  # New column #1
                    sigma = sd(hr), # New column #2
                    cv = sigma/mu)  # New column #3
head(add_columns)
```

### Creating a New Data Set From the Original {-}

Using the baseball teams from 2006, find the number of home runs per team. 

```{r}

# Subset data to only look at the year 2006
baseball2006 = subset(baseball, year == 2006)

# Split data frame into chunks by year and team 
ddply(baseball2006, c("year", "team"), 
      summarize,                         # Create new data set to summarize results
      homeruns = sum(hr))                # New column in the data set 
```
How many years did each baseball player play. 

```{r}
id_num_years = ddply(baseball,      # Data set 
                     "id",          # How to Split Data
                     summarize,     # Create new data frame with results
                     length(year))  # How many values are in each split subset of data
head(id_num_years)
```

Generate a new data frame that contains each player, the number of years they played, and the number of teams the played on. 

```{r}
id_years_teams = ddply(baseball,                       # Data set
                      "id",                            # How to split up the data set
                      summarise,                       # Generate a new data frame for results
                      duration = max(year) - min(year),# New column called duration
                      nteams = length(unique(team)))   # New column called nteams 
```

### Base R Plotting with plyr {-}

You can also plot with plyr. 

```{r}

# Subset the data set 
baseball2005_2007 = subset(baseball, year>=2005)

# Plot a histogram for each year 
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
d_ply(baseball2005_2007, "year", transform, hist(hr, main = unique(year)))
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```


### Using your own function {-}

You can create your own custom function with `plyr` just like we did with the apply functions. 


```{r}
some_stats = function(player_data){
  if(max(player_data$cyear) >=10){
    superstar = TRUE
  } else{
    superstar = FALSE
  }
  
  if(max(player_data$hr)>50){
    hrstar = TRUE 
  } else{
    hrstar = FALSE
  }
  
  return_me = c(superstar, hrstar)
  names(return_me) = c("MVP", "Hitter")
  return(return_me)
}

new_variables = ddply(baseball,    # Data set
                      "id",        # Break up data set by player
                      some_stats)
head(new_variables)
```


### More plyr Functions {-}

There are even more functions that we have not considered in this package.  For example, we have an `mapply()` version for plyr. 
 
```{r}
mdply(cbind(mean = 1:5, sd = 1:5), rnorm, n = 5)
```
 

## Comparing Base R, Loops, plyr

```{r}

# Plyr way 
system.time(ddply(baseball, "id", summarize, length(year)))

# Apply method way 
system.time(tapply(baseball$year, baseball$id,  function(x) length(x)))

# Loop way 
system.time({
  for(i in unique(baseball$id)){
    length(which(baseball$id == i))
  } 
})
```
