"],["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to R 1.1 Download and Install R and Rstudio 1.2 The RStudio Interface 1.3 Comments 1.4 Operators 1.5 Naming Conventions Additional Resources", " Chapter 1 Introduction to R In this chapter we introduce R and RStudio, which you’ll be using throughout this course to learn how to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. To straighten out which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself, and RStudio is a convenient interface for using R. As the course progresses, you are encouraged to explore beyond what we discuss; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better scientist and researcher. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some competence in R. We begin with some of the fundamental building blocks of R and Rstudio: the interface, data types, variables, importing data, and plotting data. R is widely used by the scientific community as a no-cost alternative to expensive commercial software packages like SPSS and MATLAB. It is both a statistical software analysis system and a programming environment for developing scientific applications. Scientists routinely make available for free R programs they have developed that might be of use to others. Hundreds of packages can be downloaded for all types of scientific computing applications. This chapter was written by the help of Dr. Robert Desharnais (2020). 1.1 Download and Install R and Rstudio To get started, you need to download both the R and Rstudio software. Both are available for free and there are versions for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is suggested that you download R first and then Rstudio. R can be used without RStudio, but RStudio provides a convenient user interface and programming environment for R. The details for downloading and installing these software packages varies depending on your computer and operating system. You may need permission to install the software on your computer. The links below provide access to a mirror archive at UCLA for downloading R and the developer’s site for downloading RStudio. To download R, go to the url https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran. Choose the binary distribution appropriate for your computer. Windows users will want to click on the link to “Download R for Windows” and choose “install R for the first time,” then “Download R 3.5.2 for Windows.” Mac OS users will want to click “Download R for (Mac) OS X.” Download the install package for version R-3.5.2 If you are using Mac OS X 10.9-10.10, install version R-3.3.3. If you are using OS X 10.6-10.8, install version R-3.2.1. Linux users will want to click on the link to “Download R for Linux.” You will need to choose the version of Linux that corresponds to your installation. Versions are available for Debian, RedHat, SUSE, and Ubuntu. For RStudio, use the url https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Choose the binary distribution appropriate for your computer. Installers are provided for a variety of platforms. For additional help please see this video: Getting Started 1 | How to Download and Install RStudio 1.2 The RStudio Interface We will begin by looking at the RStudio software interface. The RStudio program is referred to the window, and each section in the interface is a pane. Launch RStudio. You will see a window that looks like the figure above. The four panes of the window are described as follows: The pane in the bottom left is the R Command Console, this is where you type R commands for immediate execution. The pane in the upper left portion of the window is an area for editing R source code for scripts and functions and for viewing R data frame objects. New tabs will be added as new R code files and data objects are opened. The pane in the upper right portion of the window is an area for browsing the variables in the R workspace environment and the R command line history. The pane in the lower right portion of the window has several tabs. The Files tab is an area for browsing the files in the current working directory. The Plot tab is for viewing graphics produced using R commands. The Packages tab lists the R packages available. Other packages can be loaded. The Help tab provides access to the R documentation. The Viewer tab is for viewing local web content in the temporary session directory (not files on the web). Bottom Left Pane Let’s begin with the Console. This is where you type R commands for immediate execution. Click in the Command Console, “&gt;” symbol is the system prompt. You should see a blinking cursor that tells you the console is the current focus of keyboard input. Type: 1+2 ## [1] 3 The result tells you that the line begins with the first (and only) element of the result which is the number 3. You can also execute R’s built-in functions (or functions you add). Type the following command. exp(pi) ## [1] 23.14069 In R, “pi” is a special constant to represent the number and “exp” is the exponential function. The result tells you that the first (and only) element of the result is the number \\(e^{\\pi}=\\) 23.14069. Bottom Right Pane Now let’s look at the Files tab of the notebook at the lower right of the window. Every R session has a working directory where R looks for and saves files. It is a good practice to create a different directory for every project and make that directory the working directory. For example, let’s make a new directory called MyDirectory. (You can chose another name if you wish). Click on the Files tab of the notebook. You should see a listing of files in your default working directory. Click on the small button with an ellipsis image on the right side of the file path above the directory listing. Navigate to the folder where you want to create the new directory and click the OK button. Click on the New Folder button just below the Files tab (see right). Type MyDirectory in the panel that opens click on the folder in the Notebook. Click the More button to the right of the New Folder button and select the menu option Set as Working Directory. This new folder is now the working directory for the current R session. This menu option is a short cut for a command that was automatically entered into the R console. Top Right Pane Next we will look at the R environment, also called the R workspace. This is where you can see the names and other information on the variables that were created during your R session and are available for use in other commands. In the R console type: a &lt;- 29.325 b &lt;- log(a) c &lt;- a/b Look at the Environment pane. The variables a, b, and c are now part of your R work space. You can reuse those variables as part of other commands. In the R console type: v &lt;- c(a, b, c) v ## [1] 29.325000 3.378440 8.680041 The variable v is a vector created using the concatenate function c(). (The concatenate should not be confused with the variable c that was created earlier. Functions are always followed by parentheses that contain the function arguments). This function combines its arguments into a vector or list. Look at the Environment panel. The text num [1:3] tells us that the variable v is a vector with elements v[1], v[2], and v[3]. Top Left Pane Now let’s look at the R viewer notebook. This panel can be used to data which are data frame objects or matrix objects in R. We will begin by taking advantage of a data frame object that was built into R for demonstration purposes. We will copy it into a data frame object. In the R console, type: df &lt;- mtcars Let’s view the data. On the right side of the entry for the df object is a button we can use to view the entries of the data frame. Click on the View Button. If your look in the notebook area in the upper left portion of the window, you can see a spreadsheet-like view of the data. This is for viewing only; you cannot edit the data. Use the scroll bars to view the data entries. You can also list the data in the console by typing the name of the data fame object: df ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 The columns are labeled with the names of the variables and the rows are labeled with the names of each car. Each row represents the data values for one car; that is, each row is one observation. 1.3 Comments Often times we will want to add a comment to our script document so we can remember special aspects later, and make the code easier to read and modify in the future. To add a comment start the comment with a # symbol. This will make the remaining characters in a line a comment and R will not try to compile these lines. Go to the script document and type the following. Highlight what you have typed and press “Run”. # This is a comment 2+ 2 ## [1] 4 2 + 3 # Comments can also start in the middle of a line. ## [1] 5 1.4 Operators An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to preform a specific task. There are several types of operators, some preform mathematical tasks, logical checks, and create new objects. We will review a few of the basic operators here. We will continue to discuss and introduce operators throughout this document. Arithmetic Operators R was designed for statistical applications and as a necessity it needs to preform mathematical operations efficiently and effectively. The first operators we discuss are a few of the basic arithmetic operations. These are operations similar to that of a calculator. # Addition 2 + 3 ## [1] 5 # Subtraction 2 - 3 ## [1] -1 # Multiplication 2*3 ## [1] 6 # Division 2/3 ## [1] 0.6666667 # Exponent 2^3 ## [1] 8 Relational Operators Relational operators are used to compare two values. When using a relational operation R will return either TRUE or FALSE. # Less than 2 &lt; 3 ## [1] TRUE # Greater than 2 &gt; 3 ## [1] FALSE # Less than or equal to 2 &lt;= 3 ## [1] TRUE # Greater than or equal to 2&gt;= 3 ## [1] FALSE # Not equal to 2 != 3 ## [1] TRUE # Equal to 2 == 3 ## [1] FALSE We can use all the same operators above if our object contains more than one element. This will preform the above comparisons element by element. v ## [1] 29.325000 3.378440 8.680041 v &gt; 10 ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE If we have two vectors of an unequal length then the checks will be preformed element-by-element but the values in the shorter vector will be recycled, or repeated. w &lt;- c(10, 1) v &gt; w ## Warning in v &gt; w: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE R evaluated the first and third element of v and compared it to the first element of w, and the second element of v to the second element of w. In this case, R returned a warning alerting you that it recycled elements. However, R will not always give a warning. Logical operators Logical operators are similar to relational operators. They are used to check “AND” and “OR” events. We have the &amp; symbol which returns TRUE only if BOTH conditions are true. We also have the | symbol which returns TRUE if EITHER condition is true. # Check if both operations are true. (2 &lt; 3) &amp; (5 &lt; 4) ## [1] FALSE # Check if either operation is true. (2 &lt; 3) | (5 &lt; 4) ## [1] TRUE We can also negate a TRUE or FALSE value using the ! symbol. # Negate an operation !(2&lt;3) ## [1] FALSE Like relational operators from before, if we have more than one element the logical operations will be implemented element-by-element. # AND event, compared element-by-element (v &gt; 10) &amp; (4 &lt; 5) ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE # OR event, compared elmeent-by-elment (v &gt; 10) | (4 &lt; 5) ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE We also have the symbols &amp;&amp; and || which will ensure that only the first element in an object will be compared. # AND event, only check the first element (v &gt; 10) &amp;&amp; (4 &lt; 5) ## [1] TRUE # OR event, only check the first element (v &gt; 10) || (4 &lt; 5) ## [1] TRUE Assignment Operators Assignment operators are used to assign values to a new object. There are many types of assignment operators, and they operate slightly differently. The two most common assignment operators are = and &lt;-. With these operators the value to the left of the operator is the name of the new object and the value on the right is what the object is now equal to. x = 5 x ## [1] 5 x &lt;- 5 x ## [1] 5 The majority of the time we can use these two assignment operators above interchangeably, there are some exceptions though. There are several other assignment operators which are uncommon and should only be used by advanced users, -&gt;, &lt;&lt;-, and -&gt;&gt;. When we create new objects it is called binding. Consider the code below. v &lt;- c(6, 2, 5) In this line of code the object c(6, 2 ,5) is binded to the name v. That is, v acts as a reference (or a placeholder) for the object c(6, 2, 5). Everywhere we see the object v we should mentally replace it with this vector. 1.5 Naming Conventions R has rules when it comes to naming objects. An object may start with a letter or a ., and the remaining characters may consist of letters, digits, . or _. There are also special types of objects that have already established names in R. For example, NULL, TRUE, FALSE, if, and function should not be used as a new object name. To see a list of these reserved object names type ?Reserved in to your console.

Everything in R is an object with different properties. In this chapter we will go over vectors, these are the core fundamental objects used in R. A vector in R is a 1-dimensional object. That is, it contains a sequence of elements in a particular order. For example, v &lt;- c(2, 6, 5) is a vector with three elements. The first element is a 2, the second is a 6, and third is a 5. An object with just a single element, w &lt;- 3 is just a vector with only one value. R can represent different types of data. The types include double, integer, complex, logical, character, and raw. These are the basic fundamental objects we can use in R and are referred to as the atomic values. For our class we will not need the complex type which stores complex numbers, and in practice raw is rarely used. We will concentrate on the remaining four types. Unlike other object-oriented languages we do not need to specify what type of object we are creating when we create it. Instead, R guesses the type of object you are creating. To create an atomic vector we use the concatenate function c(), where each element of the vector is separated by a comma. This function will always create an atomic vector. double: A vector of real numbers (numbers which may contain decimal values). We can create these vectors using decimal (12.34) or scientific form (.1234e2). When using numbers this is the default type used. integer: A vector of integers (whole numbers). We can create these vectors using a integer followed by a letter L, i.e. 5L. logical: A vector containing only TRUE or FALSE values. We can create the these vectors using TRUE and FALSE explicitly, or by doing T or F. character: A vector containing strings. A string is a sequence of characters made using double quotes or single quotes, i.e. “Hello” and ‘Goodbye’. An atomic vector only contains elements of the same type. If the function c() is given a mix of elements then it will convert these elements to be all of the same type according to a hierarchy of rules. The only exception to this is for NA values. The object NA is used to indicate missingness, or the lack of a value. The value NA can occur anywhere for all types of vectors. To check the object type we can use the typeof() function. Vectors are among the most common types that are used. All of the different types of vectors we will learn about have special properties and a multitude of features that we can use. We discuss some of their key properties here, but will continue exploring and learning about their features, and introducing more object types throughout the course. 2.1 Examples Double Vectors containing double vectors are perhaps the most common. These objects are comparable to doubles in the programming language C. Both the variables a and b are double vectors. When you type a number R will default to creating a double vector. a &lt;- 17.45 typeof(a) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; b &lt;- 5 typeof(b) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; c &lt;- c(1, 12.05, 123e-4) typeof(c) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; Integer We can also create integer vectors which are specifically made to store integer values. We can do this by following a whole number with the letter L. a &lt;- 5L typeof(a) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; b &lt;-c(1L, 2L, 3L) typeof(b) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Notice that when we define b&lt;-5 and b &lt;- 5L and type b into our console it appears the same. That is, to the user the two definitions look the same. However, in R integers and doubles are stored in the computer differently and have different features. For the most part, the difference between integers and doubles is negligable; however, sometimes it can produce strange errors. Logical Logical values are either TRUE or FALSE and are created by using logical or relational operators. In other words, they are created by using statements that compare variables. There are several ways to do logical statements as we saw in Section 1.4. n &lt;- (10&lt;11) typeof(n) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; m &lt;- c(10&lt;11, 4&gt;5, 3!=1) typeof(m) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; We can also assign a value as TRUE or FALSE manually by setting it equal to TRUE or FALSE, or by using T or F. c &lt;- T typeof(c) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; # Can mix up TRUE/FALSE and T/F d &lt;-c(T, F, TRUE) typeof(d) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Character Character values are text. They are often used as data values and labels. # Double quotes first &lt;- &quot;George&quot; typeof(first) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # Single quotes last &lt;- &#39;Washington&#39; typeof(last) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; full &lt;- c(first, last) typeof(full) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 2.2 Basic Features R is a vectorized language, meaning most of the procedures, functions, and operations have been optimized to work with vectors. It is typically advantageous to utilize this feature. 2.2.1 Length We have already learned that we can create vectors using the function c(), but this can also be used to make a vector larger. To see how many elements are in a vector we use the length() function v1 = c(1, 5, 6) typeof(v1) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; length(v1) ## [1] 3 v2 = c(-0.41, -1.20, pi) typeof(v2) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; length(v2) ## [1] 3 v = c(v1, v2) typeof(v) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; length(v) ## [1] 6 v ## [1] 1.000000 5.000000 6.000000 -0.410000 -1.200000 3.141593 2.2.2 Vectorized Operations and Recylcing Vectors can be used in arithmetic computations. If the two vectors are of the same length, the computations are performed element-by-element. v1 + v2 ## [1] 0.590000 3.800000 9.141593 v1 * v2 ## [1] -0.41000 -6.00000 18.84956 Single numbers (scalars) will operate on all the vector elements in an expression. 5*v1 ## [1] 5 25 30 v1/3 ## [1] 0.3333333 1.6666667 2.0000000 If you have vectors of different sizes R will recycle values in the smaller vector in order to complete the operation. Sometimes R will give you a warning for this, but often it does not. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 30) b &lt;- c(10, 20) a + b ## Warning in a + b: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] 11 22 40 a &lt; b ## Warning in a &lt; b: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE 2.2.3 Coercion As mentioned above, all elements within a vector must be of the same type. If you attempt to create a vector where some elements are of a different type than the another then R will convert all the elements to be of one type. For example, observe what happens when we try to create a vector with logical and double values. d &lt;- c(TRUE, F, TRUE, 5, 6, 10) d ## [1] 1 0 1 5 6 10 typeof(d) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; In the above example the values for TRUE where converted into 1 and FALSE was converted into a 0. R did the above coercion automatically, but sometimes you will want to convert a vector type explicitly. To do this we use the as.*() functions, where * is replaced by “double”, “integer”, “character”, or “logical”. # Convert to a character vector char_d &lt;- as.character(d) char_d ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;10&quot; typeof(char_d) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # Convert to an integer vector e &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) typeof(e) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; e ## [1] 1 2 3 e &lt;- as.integer(e) typeof(e) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; e ## [1] 1 2 3 It is not always possible to convert vector types. Sometimes an element of a vector will fail to convert. If this happens a warning may be given, and the value is often replaced by NA. 2.2.4 Testing We can also test what type of object that we have using the is.*() function, where * is replaced by “logical”, “double”, “integer”, or “character”. These function will return TRUE is * matches the typeof() output, and will return FALSE if otherwise. # Create a double vector a &lt;- c(1, 2, 30) typeof(a) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; is.integer(a) # Returns FALSE ## [1] FALSE is.double(a) # Returns TRUE ## [1] TRUE 2.2.5 Names You can name elements of a vector as well. This will produce a named vector. Instead of referring to an elements location in a vector by its order number, you can refer to the name. We can create names for a vector using three different methods. When creating it. By assigning a character vector to names() Inline with setNames() To create a named vector using the first technique we use the = symbol where the name is on the left of the equal sign, and the element binded to that name is on the right. All of the atomic vectors can be defined so their elements are named. # Using Technique 1 for creating a named vector. named1 &lt;- c(first = &quot;Abraham&quot;, last = &quot;Lincoln&quot;) named1 ## first last ## &quot;Abraham&quot; &quot;Lincoln&quot; To create a named vector using the second technique we use the names() function. This is the most common technique. # Using Technique 2 for creating a named vector named2 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) names(named2) &lt;- c(&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;) named2 ## first second third ## 1 2 3 To create a named vector using the third technique we use the setNames() function. This is the least common technique and is hardly used. # Using Technique 3 for creating a named vector named3 &lt;- c(T, F, T) named3 &lt;- setNames(named3, c(&quot;e1&quot;, &quot;e2&quot;, &quot;e3&quot;)) named3 ## e1 e2 e3 ## TRUE FALSE TRUE To see the list of names for a vector at any point use the names() function. When this function is on the right side of an assignment operator this will produce the names of each element of the vector. # To see the names of a vector and not the elements names(named3) ## [1] &quot;e1&quot; &quot;e2&quot; &quot;e3&quot; If you want to remove the names of a vector you can use two techniques. The first technique is to redefined the vector you with to remove the names of with the unname() function. The second technique uses the names() function and sets the names to be equal to NULL. # Remove names using unname() named2 &lt;- unname(named2) named2 ## [1] 1 2 3 # Remove names using names() and NULL names(named3) &lt;- NULL named3 ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE 2.2.6 typeof() and class() The typeof() function returns the storage mode of an object, and the types of values this function will return is limited. The six atomic types of vectors each are based on the six fundamental ways R stores data. Thus when we make a standard vector, we can use the typeof() function to see which type of vector we have. There is also a function called class() which is more common to use, and what we will focus on for the rest of the course. The class() function returns very similar output as typeof(), but it can also return more specific types or forms of objects. For example, perhaps you have a vector with special properties or set up. Then you can assign this specific type of vector with a certain class that reflects these properties, and R will know to differentiate how it handles this object based on its class, instead of its storage mode (returned by typeof()). The major difference between the output of typeof() and class() for atomic vectors is that when we have an integer or double vector the class function returns “numeric” for both. v_int &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3L) class(v_int) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; v_dbl &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) class(v_dbl) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; 2.2.7 Accessing Elements of a Vector Individual elements of a vector can be obtained using an index in square brackets. An index is the location of an element in a vector. For example, the vector v_dbl&lt;- c(10, 11, 12) has three elements. The first elements index is 1, the second elements index is 2, and so on. A negative index removes that element from the vector. The v_dbl[-1] is the vector v_dbl with the first element removed. The concatenate function can be used to obtain two or more elements of a vector in any desired order. Here v_dbl[c(3,2)] returns the third and second elements of the vector v_dbl. v_dbl &lt;- c(10, 11, 12) # Only get the third element v_dbl[3] ## [1] 12 # Get all elements except the first one v_dbl[-1] ## [1] 11 12 # Get the third and second element v_dbl[c(3,2)] ## [1] 12 11 Summary There are 6 types atomic vectors, but four we will primarily focus on: character, logical, integer, and double. The c() function is used to create atomic vectors, and it combines vectors together. All elements of a vector are of the same type. typeof() and class() functions return what type of vector you have. The length() function tells us how many elements are in a vector. The names() and setNames() function can be used to create a named vector. as.*() can be used to convert the type of vector. is.*() can be used to test what type of vector you have. We can access an element of a atomic vector by using v[num], where v is the vector, and num is the index (or location) of the element we are trying to access. Summary of the vectors that we will be learning about.

Factors and lists are vectors because they a 1-dimensional sequence of elements. Factors are primarily used for categorical data, and are technically a special form of an integer type vector. However, we will simply refer to a factor vector a as a factor object. Lists are vectors where type of each element can differ. In this chapter we introduce some of the unique properties of factors and lists. 3.1 Factors In real-world problems, you often encounter data that can be classified in categories. For example, suppose a survey was conducted of a group of seven individuals, who were asked to identify their hair color. hair &lt;- c(&quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;) Here, the hair color is an example of categorical data. For the hair color variable we will typically want to store it as a factor, as opposed to a character vector. The different values that the factor can take are called levels. In R, you can create a factor with the factor(), or the as.factor() functions. f &lt;- factor(hair) f ## [1] Blonde Black Black Red Blonde Brown Black ## Levels: Black Blonde Brown Red 3.1.1 Levels Levels are one of the special properties of a factor object. Notice that when you print the factor, R displays the distinct levels below the factor. R keeps track of all the possible values in a vector, and each value is called a level of the associated factor. The levels() function shows all the levels from a factor. levels(f) ## [1] &quot;Black&quot; &quot;Blonde&quot; &quot;Brown&quot; &quot;Red&quot; If your vector contains only a subset of all the possible levels, then R will have an incomplete picture of the possible levels. Consider the following example of a vector consisting of directions. Notice that “South” is noticeably missing. directions &lt;- c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;East&quot;) f &lt;- factor(directions) f ## [1] North West North East North West East ## Levels: East North West Notice that the levels of your new factor do not contain the value “South”. R thinks that North, West, and East are the only possible levels. However, in practice, it makes sense to have all the possible directions as levels of your factor. To add all the possible levels explicitly, you specify the levels argument of the function factor(). # Make sure all possible categories are listed using the levels argument f &lt;- factor(directions, levels = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;West&quot;)) f ## [1] North West North East North West East ## Levels: North East South West R lets you assign abbreviated names for the levels. You can do this by specifying the labels argument of factor(). f &lt;- factor(directions, levels = c(&quot;North&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;West&quot;), labels = c(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;W&quot;)) f ## [1] N W N E N W E ## Levels: N E S W 3.1.2 Ordered Factor Sometimes data has some kind of natural order between elements. For example, sports analysts use a three-point scale to determine how well a sports team is competing: loss &lt; tie &lt; win. In market research, it’s very common to use a five point scale to measure perceptions: strongly disagree &lt; disagree &lt; neutral &lt; agree &lt; strongly agree. Such kind of data that is possible to place in order or scale is known as ordinal data. We can store ordinal data as an ordered factor. To create an ordered factor, use the factor() function with the argument ordered=TRUE. record &lt;- c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f &lt;- factor(record, ordered = TRUE) f ## [1] win tie loss tie loss win win ## Levels: loss &lt; tie &lt; win You can manually change which levels are lower and higher based on the order that the levels are listed. record &lt;- c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f &lt;- factor(record, ordered = TRUE, levels = c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;)) f ## [1] win tie loss tie loss win win ## Levels: win &lt; tie &lt; loss If you have no observations in one of the levels, you can drop it using the droplevels() function. record = c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f = factor(record, levels = c(&quot;loss&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;win&quot;)) droplevels(f) ## [1] win loss loss win loss win ## Levels: loss win 3.2 Factors - Basic Features 3.2.1 Length Factor objects have a lot of the same features as atomic vectors. In general, most of the features and functions we had for atomic vectors work with factors. For example, we still use the length() function to see how many elements are in a factor. length(f) ## [1] 6 3.2.2 Coercion Coercion also works similarly. We can use as.factor() to create a factor object from a pre-existing vector. As we have seen in the previous examples, the factor() function also works. record &lt;- c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f &lt;- as.factor(record) f ## [1] win loss loss win loss win ## Levels: loss win To convert a factor object to a non-factor object we still use the as.*() function. In general, it is usually easiest to convert character vectors to factor vectors, and vice versa. When we convert a factor to an integer or double vector the different levels of the factor are converted to integers in order for each level. That is, the first level listed is converted to a 1, the second level listed is converted to a 2, and so on. # Convert to a character vector as.character(f) ## [1] &quot;win&quot; &quot;loss&quot; &quot;loss&quot; &quot;win&quot; &quot;loss&quot; &quot;win&quot; # Convert to an integer vector as.integer(f) ## [1] 2 1 1 2 1 2 3.2.3 Testing/Class We can also test if we have factor or an ordered factor using is.*() as we did before. record &lt;- c(&quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;win&quot;) f &lt;- factor(record, ordered = T) # Test if the character vector is a factor is.factor(record) ## [1] FALSE # Test if we have a factor (includes both ordered and not ordered factors) is.factor(f) ## [1] TRUE # Test if we have an ordered factor (only includes ordered factors) is.ordered(f) ## [1] TRUE With all types of objects we can use the class() function. As mentioned in the previous section, this function returns the name of the type of object that you have, unlike typeof() which returns the storage mode. The output of class() returns name of a object with particular properties. For instance, a factor object. A factor object is stored like an integer vector but it has “levels” which can be utilized in special ways. # Returns storage mode (not recommended) typeof(f) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; # Returns class, which is the name of a collection of objects with similar properties # (Recommended) class(f) ## [1] &quot;ordered&quot; &quot;factor&quot; 3.2.4 Names Like standard vectors, we can name the elements in a factor using the same three techniques discussed in 2.2.5. # Using Technique 1 for creating a named vector. named1 &lt;- c(sally = &quot;win&quot;, tom = &quot;win&quot;, ed = &quot;lost&quot;, jane = &quot;tie&quot;) named1 &lt;- factor(named1) named1 ## sally tom ed jane ## win win lost tie ## Levels: lost tie win 3.2.5 Accessing Elements We can also access elements of a factor object using the same standard techniques described for accessing elements in a vector 2.2.7. # Obtain the first element named1[1] ## sally ## win ## Levels: lost tie win # Obtain the forth and second elements named1[c(4, 2)] ## jane tom ## tie win ## Levels: lost tie win 3.2.6 Frequency Tables The summary() function will give you a quick overview of the contents of a factor. hair &lt;- c(&quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;) hair &lt;- factor(hair) summary(hair) ## Black Blonde Brown Red ## 3 2 1 1 The function table() tabulates observations. table(hair) ## hair ## Black Blonde Brown Red ## 3 2 1 1 We can also use the table() and summary() functions on atomic vectors, and they will operate in a similar way. However, these functions are particularly utilized for factor objects. The table() function can also tabulate two-way frequency tables. hair &lt;- c(&quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;) own_pets &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE) hair &lt;- factor(hair) own_pets &lt;- factor(own_pets) # Two way table table(hair, own_pets) ## own_pets ## hair FALSE TRUE ## Black 2 1 ## Blonde 1 1 ## Brown 1 0 ## Red 0 1 3.3 Lists A list is an array of objects. Unlike other types of vectors, the elements in a list can belong to different classes. Lists are useful for packaging together a set of related objects. We can create a list of objects in our environment by using the list() function. # A list of mixed datatypes lst &lt;- list(1L, c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), 1.23, TRUE) lst ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;abc&quot; &quot;ABC&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1.23 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] TRUE Looking at the output above we can see that this output is structured differently than a standard vector. The location of each element of a list is denoted by [[]] instead of []. The best way to understand the contents of a list is to use the structure function str(). It provides a compact display of the internal structure of a list. lst &lt;- list(1, c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), 1.23, TRUE) str(lst) ## List of 4 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : chr [1:2] &quot;abc&quot; &quot;ABC&quot; ## $ : num 1.23 ## $ : logi TRUE Above we see that we have a list with 4 elements. The first element is of class “numeric” and contains a single number, 1. The second element is of “character” and contains two elements, which is indicated by [1:2]. The third and fourth elements are of class “numeric” and “logical”, and each contain a single element. To see the class of each indivdiual element of a list we can use the following command. sapply(lst, class) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;character&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;logical&quot; 3.3.1 Nested Lists A list can contain sublists, which in turn can contain sublists themselves, and so on. This is known as nested list or recursive vectors. lst &lt;- list(1, 3, c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), TRUE) str(lst) ## List of 5 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 3 ## $ : chr [1:2] &quot;abc&quot; &quot;ABC&quot; ## $ :List of 3 ## ..$ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## ..$ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## ..$ : chr &quot;c&quot; ## $ : logi TRUE 3.4 List - Basic Features 3.4.1 Length Despite looking different and being stored differently than atomic vectors and factors, lists have many of the same properties and features. For example, we still can use the length() function to determine how many elements are in a list. lst &lt;- list(1, 3, c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), TRUE) length(lst) ## [1] 5 In the example of both there are 5 items in a list. The first two elements are double vectors of length 1, the third element is a character vector of length two, the fourth element is a list of length three, and the fifth element is a logical vector of length 1. Add elements to a list using c() as we did before with atomic vectors. lst_char &lt;- list(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) lst_num &lt;- list(100, 99, 0) lst &lt;- c(lst_num, lst_char) str(lst) ## List of 6 ## $ : num 100 ## $ : num 99 ## $ : num 0 ## $ : chr &quot;a&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;b&quot; ## $ : chr &quot;c&quot; 3.4.2 Coercion We can convert atomic vectors and factors into lists by simply using the as.list() function. The as.list() function lets each element in a vector correspond to each element in the list. So the first element of the vector becomes the first element of the list, the second element of the vector becomes the second element of the list, and so on. We could also use the list() function but this will convert a vector into a list in a different way. num_vec &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) num_lst &lt;- as.list(num_vec) str(num_lst) ## List of 3 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 3 We can convert lists to one of the other types of vectors using the as.*() function with the desired vector type as we did earlier. However, if we do not have a desired type in mind we can also use the unlist() function. The unlist() function takes all atomic objects in a list and creates an atomic vector. In this case R will “guess” which type of atomic vector you would like. unlist(num_lst) ## [1] 1 2 3 3.4.3 Testing/Class We can determine if an object is a list or not by using is.list() or the class() functions. is.list(num_lst) ## [1] TRUE class(num_lst) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; 3.4.4 Names Lists can also be named, and often are. It is very common to created named lists because lists can have a mix of different types objects. We can create a named list using all the same techniques that we used for creating named vectors (2.2.5) . Notice, we do not have to create a name for every element in a list. Below we see the first two elements are named, and the last is not. lst &lt;- list(first = &quot;Abraham&quot;, last = &quot;Lincoln&quot;, 1860) lst ## $first ## [1] &quot;Abraham&quot; ## ## $last ## [1] &quot;Lincoln&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1860 3.4.5 Accessing Elements Accessing elements in a list is a little different than accessing elements in a vector. As you may have already noticed, when a list is outputted into our console the elements in the list are denoted by their index number inside of double brackets, i.e. [[2]]. To access this individual element in a list we use double brackets. This isolates that individual element, and the class of this element is no longer a list but the class of the original element. lst[[1]] ## [1] &quot;Abraham&quot; class(lst[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; We can still use single brackets to access elements in a list, but this method of indexing simply subsets the list. That is, it still returns us a list, just a smaller one based on the indices called. lst[1] ## $first ## [1] &quot;Abraham&quot; class(lst[1]) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; lst &lt;- list(1, 3, c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;), list(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), TRUE) lst[c(3, 1)] ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;abc&quot; &quot;ABC&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1 class(lst[c(3,1)]) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; Summary Factors are special types of vectors which are primarily used for categorical data. Factors can be ordered or unordered. We create factor objects using the factor() function. Lists are vectors which can have a mix of classes/types of objects. We create a factor or list using the functions factor() or list() We can use the same basic functions with factors and lists as we do with atomic vectors: length(), as.*(), is.*(), class() We have the same basic properties with factors and lists as we do with atomic vectors: length() determine how long an object is c() combine two objects of the same class together same naming techniques same indexing strategies We can also access individual elements of a list using [[]], which isolates an element and takes it out of the list structure.

"],["matrices-data-frames-and-more.html", "Chapter 4 Matrices, Data Frames, and More 4.1 Matrices 4.2 Data Frames 4.3 Basic Features of Matrices/Data-Frames 4.4 Other Object Types and the Global Environment Summary", " Chapter 4 Matrices, Data Frames, and More 4.1 Matrices A matrix is a two dimensional array of data of the same type. The matrix function, matrix(), can be used to create a new matrix. m &lt;- matrix(c(1, 9, 2, 0, 5, 7, 3, 8, 4), nrow=3, ncol=3) m ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 3 ## [2,] 9 5 8 ## [3,] 2 7 4 R labels the rows and columns for us in the output. The matrix is filled column-by-column using the elements of the vector created by the concatenate function. The matrix m above is a matrix composed of doubles (the atomic object). This is the default type of matrix R creates, and it is by far the most common matrix used. However, we can also create integer matrices, logical matrices, and character matrices. # Example of a matrix with logical values m_logical &lt;- matrix(c(T, T, T, F, F, F, T, T), nrow = 4, ncol = 2) m_logical ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] TRUE FALSE ## [2,] TRUE FALSE ## [3,] TRUE TRUE ## [4,] FALSE TRUE 4.1.1 Vectorized Operations As with vectors, matrices can be used in arithmetic operations with scalars and other matrices of the same size. We still have all the same basic vectorized operations. m2 &lt;- m/2 m2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.5 0.0 1.5 ## [2,] 4.5 2.5 4.0 ## [3,] 1.0 3.5 2.0 m *m2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.5 0.0 4.5 ## [2,] 40.5 12.5 32.0 ## [3,] 2.0 24.5 8.0 4.2 Data Frames Like a matrix, a data frame is a rectangular array of values where each column is a vector. However, unlike a matrix, the columns can be different data types. We can create a set of vectors of the same length and use the data.frame() function to make a data frame object. age &lt;- c(1, 8, 10, 30, 31) gender &lt;- c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;) married &lt;- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) simpsons &lt;- data.frame(age, gender, married) simpsons ## age gender married ## 1 1 Female FALSE ## 2 8 Female FALSE ## 3 10 Male FALSE ## 4 30 Female TRUE ## 5 31 Male TRUE class(simpsons) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; To see all the class of each column in a data frame we can use the following command. sapply(simpsons, class) ## age gender married ## &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;character&quot; &quot;logical&quot; 4.2.1 Column Names Data frames always have column names. In the example above we used vectors to create a data frame. When we use this technique then the name of the vector is automatically selected as the column name. If we have inputted a vector like c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as an argument in the data.frame() function instead of an object name, then R would have guessed what to name the column. Matrices do not have this property. Matrices do not usually have column or row names (but they can, as we will see below). In contrast, data frames always have column names, and often have row names too. In the following section we discuss how to change the row and column names of both matrices and data frames explicitly. 4.3 Basic Features of Matrices/Data-Frames 4.3.1 Dimensions To access and determine the size or dimensions of a matrix and data frame there are three important functions. We no longer would want to use the length() function because that is for 1-dimsional objects. Since matrices and data frames are 2-dimensional objects we now must consider both dimensions. The three functions we can use to do this are dim(), nrow(), and ncol(). The dim() function returns the number of rows and the number of columns. The nrow() just returns the number of rows, and ncol() just returns the number of columns. dim(simpsons) ## [1] 5 3 nrow(simpsons) ## [1] 5 ncol(simpsons) ## [1] 3 4.3.2 Accesing Elements Indices can be used to obtain the elements of a matrix and data frame, but now we must consider both the row and column. We can access an individual point in a matrix or data frame using [row, colum], where row is the row index and column is the column index. m &lt;- matrix(c(1, 9, 2, 0, 5, 7, 3, 8, 4), nrow=3, ncol=3) m[2,2] ## [1] 5 We can access multiple elements using the c() function. Note we must use the c() function to separate the rows and columns we are trying isolate because the common inside the single brackets separates the dimensions. # Isolate multiple individual points. m[c(1,3), c(1,3)] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 3 ## [2,] 2 4 We can also isolate entire rows or columns by leaving one of the dimensions blank. # Isolate the second row m[2,] ## [1] 9 5 8 # Isolate the third column m[,3] ## [1] 3 8 4 We can think of these individual rows or columns as an individual vector. vec &lt;- simpsons[,2] vec ## [1] &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Male&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Male&quot; 4.3.3 Coercion We often do not need to convert matrices and data frames, but if we do we can use the as.matrix() or as.data.frame() on a pre-existing object to convert it into a matrix or data frame. The most common type of coercion that we have for 2-dimensional objects is changing the class of a column in a data frame. To do this we can redefine this class explicitly using indexing. # Changing the class of a single column simpsons[, 1] &lt;- as.factor(simpsons[, 1]) sapply(simpsons, class) ## age gender married ## &quot;factor&quot; &quot;character&quot; &quot;logical&quot; simpsons ## age gender married ## 1 1 Female FALSE ## 2 8 Female FALSE ## 3 10 Male FALSE ## 4 30 Female TRUE ## 5 31 Male TRUE 4.3.4 Testing/Class We can test or determine what type of object we have using the class() function. Again, this function will always return something for a given object. If we have a data frame or matrix it will return “data.frame” or “matrix”, respectively. We can also use the is.matrix() or is.data.frame() functions which will return TRUE/FALSE values. 4.3.5 Names With both matrices and data frames we can name the rows and columns. Data frames will always have column names, but matrices do not have to have them. It is very commmon to name the rows and columns for a data frame, but not as common for matrices. Matrices are most often used for linear algebra calculations. To see the row or column names of a 2-dimensional object we can use the rownames() and colnames() functions. rownames(simpsons) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; colnames(simpsons) ## [1] &quot;age&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;married&quot; To change these names we use the same functions, and just manually reassign the values for them. rownames(simpsons) &lt;- c(&quot;Maggie&quot;, &quot;Lisa&quot;, &quot;Bart&quot;, &quot;Marge&quot;, &quot;Homer&quot;) simpsons ## age gender married ## Maggie 1 Female FALSE ## Lisa 8 Female FALSE ## Bart 10 Male FALSE ## Marge 30 Female TRUE ## Homer 31 Male TRUE colnames(simpsons) &lt;- c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Gender&quot;, &quot;Married&quot;) simpsons ## Age Gender Married ## Maggie 1 Female FALSE ## Lisa 8 Female FALSE ## Bart 10 Male FALSE ## Marge 30 Female TRUE ## Homer 31 Male TRUE 4.4 Other Object Types and the Global Environment There are more objects then what we have discussed above. For example, many of the advanced functions create specific objects generated by that specific function. There are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of such objects. These objects generally are special cases of lists, factors, and other various types of objects that we have defined in this section. The objects we have described here are the building blocks of most values we will be working with. Functions like class() and length() are also considered as objects, but are of a different type. We discuss functions in more detail in section 7. There are also built-in, or special objects in R. For example, the object pi is an object already defined. These built-in values and functions can be written over, but that is not advised. pi ## [1] 3.141593 Every time we create an object we see that the Global Environment tab in the top right pane updates. The object we have created is now listed in the Global Environment. This is a collection of all user created objects in R, that R knows about, and that R can easily call. Built-in objects, such as pi, will not be listed here. Summary The basic and most common 2-dimensional objects are matrices and data frames. Matrices must contain all data of the same type. Data frames can have different classes between columns, and always have column names. We can create a matrix or data frame using the matrix() and data.frame() functions. Many vectorized operations still work for 2-dimensional objects. We can look at and name both rows and columns using rownames() and colnames(). To see the dimensions of a 2-dimensional object we use dim(), nrow() and ncol(). We can check if we have a matrix or data frame by using class() or is.*(). To access elements of a 2-dimsional object we use [row, column].

The process of indexing, is also sometimes called subsetting. In R the index of an object is the numeric location of that object. For example, consider the vector vec &lt;- c(100, 20, 3). The index of the first element is 1, the index of the second element is 2, and the so on. We have already seen a few examples of indexing for vectors and factors, lists, and 2D objects. In this section we more formally describe a plethora of indexing techniques. Indexing can be hard to master in R because of the many options, and the different types of objects. In this section we will describe the basic indexing techniques for atomic vector and factors, lists, matrices, and data frames. The indexing between the methods are all related, so it useful to talk about them all together. At the end of this section we give examples of a few features and applications we can do with indexing. 5.1 Atomic Vectors and Factors We have already seen a little big of indexing with vectors (atomic, factors, and lists). Now we will discuss indexing in more detail for 1D Objects. We will focus specifically on atomic vectors. The techniques here can be used with other types and classes of vectors though. For indexing with vectors we only have one indexing operator, []. We also have four general strategies that we will focus on. Suppose we wish to preform indexing on a vector vec. # Generate a random vector with the following code set.seed(10) vec &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # numeric vector with 10 values vec ## [1] 9 74 76 55 72 54 39 83 88 15 Four basic strategies: positive integer: When using the positive integer strategy we use a vector index which only contains positive integers of the indexes. This vector can be of any positive finite length. That means it can be of length 1, length 10, or even length 10000. We use this operator by calling vec[index], which will return the elements of vec by their indices as ordered from index. negative integer: The negative integer strategy works similarly. This time we consider a vector index which only contains negative integers, and must have a positive length between 1 and the length of vec. These correspond to the elements of vec you would like to exclude. logical elements: When using the logical strategy we use a vector index which contains only logical (TRUE/FALSE) values. In this strategy index must be the same length as the vector vec. If it is not, R will use recycling to complete the command. The TRUE values in index represent the elements of vec you wish to keep, and FALSE values represent the elements you wish to exclude. names: If vec is a named vector we can also use the names to preform indexing. In this case the vector index should be a character vector where each element of the vector is the name of an element in vec that we wish to keep. We can not use a negative operator, or a negative sign with this strategy to exclude variables. We can not mix and max these strategies within a command. We can only use one strategy at a time. Example: Positive Integers # Obtaining a single element vec[1] ## [1] 9 # Obtaining several elements: Get 1st, 2nd, 3rd element vec[c(1, 2, 3)] ## [1] 9 74 76 # Get mutliples of the same element index &lt;- c(3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3) vec[index] ## [1] 76 74 9 9 9 74 76 Example: Negative Integers # Remove first element vec[1] ## [1] 9 # Remove several elements: 1st, 2nd, 3rd vec[-c(1, 2, 3)] ## [1] 55 72 54 39 83 88 15 # Equivalent to above index &lt;- c(-1, -2, -3) vec[index] ## [1] 55 72 54 39 83 88 15 Example: Logical Values # `index` should be the same length as `vec` index &lt;- c(T, T, T, T, F, F, F, F, F, T) vec[index] ## [1] 9 74 76 55 15 # When `index` is not of the same length as `vec`, we have recycling # Keeps every other element index &lt;- c(T, F) vec[index] ## [1] 9 76 72 39 88 Example: Names # Give names to each element in `vec` names(vec) &lt;- LETTERS[1:10] # Return Elements: A, B, D index &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) vec[index] ## A B D ## 9 74 55 5.2 Lists Although lists are 1D objects, they have three different operators: [], [[]], and $. The first operator works the same way as we saw above for atomic vectors. We can use all four strategies we used in the prior section, and a new list will appear according to the indexing order. The new operators are [[]] and $, these operators are very similar. They both can only isolate one element in the list, and they return this element in its particular class. That is, if the second element in the list is data frame, then a data frame is returned with the [[]] and $ operators. 5.2.1 Double Brackets With the double brackets operator [[index]] we can put the index number for the element we want returned, or if we have a named list, we can put the name of the element we desire. Remember, you can only isolate one element in the list using this operator, so index must be of length 1. # Create a named list # Recall: name = value lst1 &lt;- list(first = c(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Goodbye&quot;), second = c(1, 2, 3), third = c(T, F, T)) # Create a nested list with names lst2 &lt;- list(e1 = lst1, e2 = &quot;Stat 107 Rules&quot;) # See structure of the list str(lst2) ## List of 2 ## $ e1:List of 3 ## ..$ first : chr [1:2] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;Goodbye&quot; ## ..$ second: num [1:3] 1 2 3 ## ..$ third : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE ## $ e2: chr &quot;Stat 107 Rules&quot; # Isolate second element by name (maintains class of the element) lst2[[&quot;e2&quot;]] ## [1] &quot;Stat 107 Rules&quot; class(lst2[[&quot;e2&quot;]]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # Isolate second element by integer (maintains class of the element) lst2[[2]] ## [1] &quot;Stat 107 Rules&quot; class(lst2[[2]]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # Isolate nested elements lst2[[1]][[2]] ## [1] 1 2 3 5.2.2 Dollar Sign After the dollar sign operator $ we put the name of the desired element. You can only isolate one element in the list using this operator, and you can only access elements using their names. However, if you have # Isolate second element by name (maintains class of the element) lst2$e2 ## [1] &quot;Stat 107 Rules&quot; # Isolate nested elements lst2$e1$second ## [1] 1 2 3 You can also mix and match indexing methods for lists. lst1$second[2] ## [1] 2 5.3 Matrices For matrices we will only consider three indexing techniques, these are by far the most popular. There is only one operator we need to consider for matrices, and it is the same one we use for vectors []. Inside this operator you can put in two vectors, or a single vector. 5.3.1 Two Vectors Using two vectors when indexing a list is by far the most common, and the recommended way to index a matrix. It is easy to read, and standard practice. For this technique you use [row, column], where row is a vector of index values of the rows you wish to isolate, and column is a vector of the index values of the columns you wish to isolate. The vectors row and column support positive integers, negative integers, logical vectors, and character vectors with row and column names. That is, we can index the rows and columns of a matrix in the same way we did before with standard vectors, but now we have two dimensions to consider. Like before, the vectors row and column must be all positive values, all negative values, all logical, or only contain the respective names. However, the values between vectors can differ. For example, row can be a vector of positive integers, and column can be a vector of logical values. In general, a matrix returns another matrix, or it returns a vector. my_m &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) colnames(my_m) &lt;- c(&quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;, &quot;C3&quot;) my_m ## C1 C2 C3 ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 # Obtain a full row my_m[1,] ## C1 C2 C3 ## 1 4 7 # Obtain a full column my_m[,2] ## [1] 4 5 6 # All rows but the first, and get the last two columns my_m[-1, c(&quot;C2&quot;, &quot;C3&quot;)] ## C2 C3 ## [1,] 5 8 ## [2,] 6 9 5.3.2 Single Vector Matrices can be thought of as a special shaped atomic vector where the first elements of the vector are the first column (from top to bottom), the next elements are the second column (top to bottom), and so on. In fact, R supports indexing matrices using this idea. If attempt to subset a matrix using [index], where index is a single vector, then the values of index will correspond register the values of the matrix in this order. It is not particularly common to index in this way, and not recommended because it is not particularly clear. my_m[1] ## [1] 1 my_m[c(1, 9)] ## [1] 1 9 my_m[-c(1, 9)] ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 5.4 Data frames Data frames can be indexed in all the ways that matrices can be indexed above. They also have a few more techniques. At its core, can think of data frames as a special type of list in which each element of the list is a vector of the same length. Data frames have three indexing operators [], [[]], and $. The [] operator works identically for data frames, as it does matrices, that is we can supply this operator two vectors [row, column] or one [index]. Thus, we will focus on the other two operators. Recall from indexing lists that [[]] and $ can only access one element of a list. When using [[]] and $ on data frames these operators can only access one column.

These are special functions and things that we can do with the indexing we dicussed so far. 5.5.1 Indexing and Reassignment Recall the vector vec we created above. With all of the indexing techniques we discussed before, we can combine indexing with reassignment. We can reassign values inside of a vector via their index number. This can be done with all the objects and techniques we have learned. For example, recall the vector vec we created above. We can reassign the first three elements of vec to be 62. # `vec` from above # Generate a random vector with the following code set.seed(10) vec &lt;- sample(1:100, 10) # numeric vector with 10 values vec ## [1] 9 74 76 55 72 54 39 83 88 15 # reassign first three values of vec using index vec[1:3] &lt;- 62 vec ## [1] 62 62 62 55 72 54 39 83 88 15 The only values that are changed are the ones we isolated via indexing. Lets see another example with logical values. In this example we use the logical indexing technique to isolate only values that meet a certain condition. So the vector index_to_change contains logical values where TRUE indicates that the values in vec are greater than 50, and FALSE if otherwise. So when we use vec_chr[index_to_change] it changes all elements which correspond to TRUE to be equal to Big. It does not update any other elements in the vector vec_chr. # Make a character vector vec_chr &lt;- as.character(vec) # Reassign elements to &quot;Big&quot; if they are a big number # Do not change other elements index_to_change &lt;- vec&gt;50 vec_chr[index_to_change] &lt;- &quot;Big&quot; vec_chr ## [1] &quot;Big&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;39&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;Big&quot; &quot;15&quot; Here is another example where we reassign a column name of the matrix my_m to be “my_c2”. # Recall matrix my_m ## C1 C2 C3 ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 # Reassign just one column name colnames(my_m)[2] &lt;- &quot;my_c2&quot; Now lets reassign the value in the second row, second column to be NA. my_m[2, &quot;my_c2&quot;] &lt;- NA my_m ## C1 my_c2 C3 ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 NA 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 5.5.2 Ordering/Integer Indexing As we saw above, we can also using indexing with positive integers and names to rearrange values in an object. If we want to do a rearrangement based on smallest to largest value (or vice versa), or alphabetical (or reverse alphabetical), we can do this directly with the order() function. This function returns the ranks of the variable being sorted. # Example data frame group &lt;- c(&quot;G1&quot;, &quot;G2&quot;, &quot;G1&quot;, &quot;G1&quot;, &quot;G2&quot;) age &lt;- c(35, 30, 31, 28, 40) height &lt;- c(65, 70, 60, 72, 68) pets &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) mydata &lt;- data.frame(group, age, height, pets) mydata ## group age height pets ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE # Indices in smallest to largest order order(mydata$age) ## [1] 4 2 3 1 5 # Rearrange data frame to be from shortest to tallest mydata[order(mydata$age),] ## group age height pets ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE mydata[order(mydata$group, mydata$age),] ## group age height pets ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE We can sort by more than one variable. Including more than one variable allows a “nested sort,” where the second variable, third variable, etc., is used when there are ties in the sorting based on the previous variables. Let’s first sort by group alone, and then by group followed by age and see what we get. # Sort just by &quot;group&quot; mydata[order(mydata$group), ] ## group age height pets ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE # Rearrange data frame FIRST by &quot;group&quot;, SECOND by &quot;age&quot; mydata[order(mydata$group, mydata$age), ] ## group age height pets ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE To reorder a vector from smallest to largest we can also consider the sort() function. sort(mydata$age) ## [1] 28 30 31 35 40 5.5.3 Adding Elements/Rows/Columns To add an element/row/column to an object we can also use indexing and the assignment operator. To do so, we put the new index number or index name with our indexing operator, and assign a value.

Logical indexing is actually very helpful and common! One of the big reasons we use logical vectors for indexing is to select elements that meet a certain condition. For example, maybe we want only want to display elements of a vector that are larger than 50. # diplays elements of vec that are larger than 50 vec[vec &gt; 50] ## [1] 62 62 62 55 72 54 83 88 1000 We can also reassignment elements of a vector that meet a certain condition. This uses ideas from 5.5.1. # Reassign values in vec2 to be NA if they are greater than 50. vec2 &lt;- vec vec2[vec2&gt;50] &lt;- NA vec2 ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA 39 NA NA 15 NA We can of course also use this strategy on all other objects that support the [] operator, which is everything so far! # display rows of iris that have species == &quot;setosa&quot; iris[iris$Species==&quot;setosa&quot;, ] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 8 5.0 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 11 5.4 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 12 4.8 3.4 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 13 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 15 5.8 4.0 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 16 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 17 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa ## 18 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 19 5.7 3.8 1.7 0.3 setosa ## 20 5.1 3.8 1.5 0.3 setosa ## 21 5.4 3.4 1.7 0.2 setosa ## 22 5.1 3.7 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 23 4.6 3.6 1.0 0.2 setosa ## 24 5.1 3.3 1.7 0.5 setosa ## 25 4.8 3.4 1.9 0.2 setosa ## 26 5.0 3.0 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 27 5.0 3.4 1.6 0.4 setosa ## 28 5.2 3.5 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 29 5.2 3.4 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 30 4.7 3.2 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 31 4.8 3.1 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 32 5.4 3.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 33 5.2 4.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## 34 5.5 4.2 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 35 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 36 5.0 3.2 1.2 0.2 setosa ## 37 5.5 3.5 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 38 4.9 3.6 1.4 0.1 setosa ## 39 4.4 3.0 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 40 5.1 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 41 5.0 3.5 1.3 0.3 setosa ## 42 4.5 2.3 1.3 0.3 setosa ## 43 4.4 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 44 5.0 3.5 1.6 0.6 setosa ## 45 5.1 3.8 1.9 0.4 setosa ## 46 4.8 3.0 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 47 5.1 3.8 1.6 0.2 setosa ## 48 4.6 3.2 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 49 5.3 3.7 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 50 5.0 3.3 1.4 0.2 setosa 5.5.6 Convert Indexing Techniques With all these methods it can sometimes be difficult to remember which is which. However, we will often find ourselves naturally gravitating to one technique over another. There are different operators and functions in R that help us convert the different techniques. For example, the which() function helps us switch from logical indexing to positive integer indexing. # Switch from logical strategy, to positive integer strategy index &lt;- which(vec &gt;50) index ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 11 vec[index] ## [1] 62 62 62 55 72 54 83 88 1000 The %in% operator helps us make a check if elements in the object values are in the set keep, i.e. values %in% keep. # Returns logical vector of column names to keep keep &lt;- c(&quot;species&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Length&quot;) colnames(iris) %in% keep ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Summary Indexing operators [], [[]], $ []: Used with 1d and 2d objects Positive Integers Negative Integers Name Logical [[]]: Used with lists or Data frames. Can only isolate one element or column. Positive Integers Name $: Used with lists or Data frames. Can only isolate one element or column. Name Indexing can be combined with reassignment. Some important functions and operators to remember: order(), sort(), which(), %in%. "],["working-with-data-sets.html", "Chapter 6 Working with Data Sets 6.1 Getting Data Sets in Our Working Environment 6.2 Basic Data Manipulation Summary", " Chapter 6 Working with Data Sets In this section we discuss different methods for loading data sets into our R session. There are many different files we can create and import. We will focus our attention on loading csv files because they tend to be easier to import, and they are one of the more typical file types that are used. In the second half of the this chapter we introduce some more basic data manipulation strategies and helpful functions when working with data sets beyond indexing. 6.1 Getting Data Sets in Our Working Environment Built-In Data As discussed last week, there are built in objects which are not loaded into the global environment, but can be called upon at any time. For example pi returns the value 3.1415927. Similarly, there are built in data sets that are ready to be used and loaded at a moments notice. To see a list of built in data sets type in the console: data() These data sets can be used even if they are not listed in the global environment. For example, if you would like to load the data set in the global environment, run the following command: data(&quot;cars&quot;) Importing From Your Computer Although built-in data sets are convient, most the time we need to load our own datasets. We load our own data sets by using a function specifically designed for the file type of interest. This function usually uses the file path location as an argument. This can be done in many different ways; however, we will only go over two. Option 1 Download the file InsectData.csv from ELearn. Save this file in a spot in your computer you will remember. In the Environment window (upper left window), click on the Import Dataset button. A drop down menu will appear. Select the From Text (base)… option. Find the file InsectData.csv and select it. A pop up menu will appear giving you options for loading in the file, and showing a preview of what the file will look like once loaded. Select the appropriate options and click Import. A new line of code has generated in the console which will read the data into your current environment. Copy and paste this into your R script document if you would like to save this line of code for later. You will have to reload this file into your environment each time you start a new R session and would like to use this file. Option 2 Download the file InsectData.csv from ELearn. Save this file in a spot in your computer you will remember. In the lower right hand window select the File tab. Now search for the file which you have saved InsectData.csv. Click on the file InsectData.csv in order to see a dropdown menu. Select Import Dataset… A window will appear which will give you options and a preview of your file. Select appropriate options if needed then click Import. A new line of code has generated in the console which will read the data into your current environment. Copy and paste this into your R script document if you would like to save this line of code for later. You will have to reload this file into your environment each time you start a new R session and would like to use this file. Import From Online We can also download data sets from online in a variety of different ways. Below is one option. With this method we are using the same InsectData.csv file, but it has been posted online. We feed the url of where the data set has been posted into the read.csv() function in order to open the file. the_url &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpkgarcia/LearnRBook/main/data_sets/InsectData.csv&quot; the_data &lt;- read.csv(the_url) 6.2 Basic Data Manipulation Lets recall a few useful things about data frames. As we learned already, data sets are contained in an object called a data frame. One can view this as a specialized table or matrix of rows and columns, where each column is a data variable, such as height or age, and each row is a single observation. All of the values within a column must be the same data type (numeric,factor, logical, etc.). Data frames can be created or called within R, imported from text or spreadsheet files, or imported from the web. group &lt;- c(&quot;G1&quot;, &quot;G2&quot;, &quot;G1&quot;, &quot;G1&quot;, &quot;G2&quot;) age &lt;- c(35, 30, 31, 28, 40) height &lt;- c(65, 70, 60, 72, 68) pets &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) mydata &lt;- data.frame(group, age, height, pets) mydata ## group age height pets ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE The summary() function is a powerful command that gives you some summary statistics about the variables in the data frame. summary(mydata) ## group age height pets ## Length:5 Min. :28.0 Min. :60 Mode :logical ## Class :character 1st Qu.:30.0 1st Qu.:65 FALSE:2 ## Mode :character Median :31.0 Median :68 TRUE :3 ## Mean :32.8 Mean :67 ## 3rd Qu.:35.0 3rd Qu.:70 ## Max. :40.0 Max. :72 The summary statistics are listed below the names of the variables. Since pets is a logical variable, R gives you the frequencies of each unique value. In this example there are three values of TRUE and two values of FALSE. Since age and weight are numeric, R computes and returns the minimum, 1st quartile (25th percentile), median, mean, 3rd quartile (75th percentile), and maximum values. If you have many data values, this is a quick way to get a feel for how the data are distributed. Just like we did for vectors, we can also use the table() to cross-tabulate categorical data. Let’s create a frequency table for the different groups. table(mydata$group) ## ## G1 G2 ## 3 2 We can also create a frequency table of pet status for both groups. table(mydata$group, mydata$pets) ## ## FALSE TRUE ## G1 2 1 ## G2 0 2 Subset We already discussed how powerful indexing techniques can be, and various different ways to use indexing to subset a data set. We also have the subset() function which accomplishes much of the same tasks, and can be used as an alternative to many indexing operations. For example, we can subset a data frame by isolating all rows that belong to group “G1”. group1 &lt;- subset(mydata, mydata$group == &quot;G1&quot;) group1 ## group age height pets ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE To subset by all values which are NOT equal to a condition we can use the logical operator !=. group2 &lt;- subset(mydata, mydata$group != &quot;G1&quot;) group2 ## group age height pets ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE Adding Columns One can add a new variable (column) to a data frame by defining a new variable and assigning values to it. Below we add a weight variable to the data frame. wghts &lt;- c(169, 161, 149, 165, 155) wghts ## [1] 169 161 149 165 155 mydata$weight &lt;- wghts mydata ## group age height pets weight ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE 169 ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE 161 ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE 149 ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE 165 ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE 155 We can also add a new column using the cbind() function. mydata &lt;- cbind(mydata, wghts) mydata ## group age height pets weight wghts ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE 169 169 ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE 161 161 ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE 149 149 ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE 165 165 ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE 155 155 NA values In addition, if we have a missing value, or a blank value, we can use the object NA to indicate the lack of a value. fav_color &lt;- c(&quot;Red&quot;, NA, &quot;Purple&quot;, NA, &quot;Red&quot;) mydata &lt;- cbind(mydata, fav_color) mydata ## group age height pets weight wghts fav_color ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE 169 169 Red ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE 161 161 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE 149 149 Purple ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE 165 165 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE 155 155 Red We can drop check for NA values using the is.na() function. is.na(mydata) ## group age height pets weight wghts fav_color ## [1,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [2,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [3,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [4,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [5,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE We can remove all rows with NA values using na.omit(). na.omit(mydata) ## group age height pets weight wghts fav_color ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE 169 169 Red ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE 149 149 Purple ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE 155 155 Red NULL One can drop a variable (column) by setting it equal to the R value NULL. mydata$wghts &lt;- NULL mydata ## group age height pets weight fav_color ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE 169 Red ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE 161 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE 149 Purple ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE 165 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE 155 Red Be careful using these methods. Once a variable or row is dropped, it’s gone. Adding Rows Rows can be added to a data frame using the rbind() (row bind) function. Because our columns have different data types, we will create a list object and then add it as a new row. newobs &lt;- list(&quot;G1&quot;, 23, 62, FALSE, 160, &quot;Blue&quot;) newdata &lt;- rbind(mydata, newobs) newdata ## group age height pets weight fav_color ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE 169 Red ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE 161 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE 149 Purple ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE 165 &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE 155 Red ## 6 G1 23 62 FALSE 160 Blue We can also use rbind() to append one data frame to another. We can do this with the variables group1 and group2 created above still exist in your R environment. group1 ## group age height pets ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE group2 ## group age height pets ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE rbind(group1, group2) ## group age height pets ## 1 G1 35 65 TRUE ## 3 G1 31 60 FALSE ## 4 G1 28 72 FALSE ## 2 G2 30 70 TRUE ## 5 G2 40 68 TRUE Summary How to get data Use default data sets data() Load csv files with read.csv() and read_csv() Download data from online Data manipulation functions to keep in mind table(), summary() subset() rbind(), cbind() na.omit(), is.na() "],["functions.html", "Chapter 7 Functions 7.1 Build Your Own Function 7.2 Lexical Scoping 7.3 Built-In Functions 7.4 Help Files 7.5 The … Argument 7.6 Generic Functions Additional Resources", " Chapter 7 Functions In R we have functions, functions are another type of object in R. We use functions in order to preform a series of tasks repeatedly, or preform these tasks in different settings. They can make our code much more efficient. We can build our own functions or we can use built in functions. Here we describe both types and their properties. Parts of this chapter where adapted by John Blischak, Daniel Chen, Harriet Dashnow, and Denis Haine (2016) and Vries and Meys (2015). 7.1 Build Your Own Function To define a function, a name is assigned and the keyword function is used to denote the start of the function and its argument list. Functions are created using the function() directive and are stored as R objects just like anything else. In particular, they are R objects of class function. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside another function. Below is the general template function_name &lt;- function(arg){ # Function Body .... return(return_value) } In this template we have the following key components function_name: This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name. function: A directive which tells R a function is being created. arg: An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values. function body: The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does. return_value: The output value of the function. If return(return_value) is not supplied then the return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated. Your function can only return one object. This object can be any class of object you desire, like a vector, list or data frame, but you may only return one object. Below is an example of converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. # Convert temperature from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C) # ARGUMENTS: temp_F, a numeric vector of length 1 in F units # RETURNS: temp_C, a numeric vector of length 1 in C units fahrenheit_to_celsius &lt;- function(temp_F){ temp_C = (temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9 return(temp_C) } In this example the function name is fahrenheit_to_celsius, there is only one input or argument, temp_F, and the output is the object temp_C. Now if we would like to “call” this function we can simply put into the command console the function name and desired input. # Convert 87F to Celsius fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_F = 87) ## [1] 30.55556 What would happen if we tried to call this function without supplying an input? This would result in an error. # temp_F not defined. fahrenheit_to_celsius() Error in fahrenheit_to_celsius() : argument &quot;temp_F&quot; is missing, with no default With functions we can define function arguments to have default values. These default values are used only if the user did not supply an argument value. Observe the example below. # An example function, does simply algebra # ARGUMENTS: a = 1 (default), a numeric vector of length 1 # b, a numeric vector of length 1 # RETURNS: d, a numeric vector of length 1 example_func &lt;- function(a = 1, b){ c = a + b d = c + 1 # returns a+b+1 return(d) } # Call example function example_func(a= 2, b= 3) ## [1] 6 example_func(b = 3) ## [1] 5 Further notice that R has three ways to match function inputs to the formal arguments of the function definition. R attempts to match inputs to arguements in the following order. by complete name by partial name (matching on initial n characters of the argument name) by position After running a function command R first attempts to match arguments by complete name, then by partial name, and then by position. If it unable to match inputs to an argument it then uses the default argument value, if one exists. Observe: example_func(2, 3) ## [1] 6 example_func(b = 3, a = 2) ## [1] 6 example_func(a = 2, b = 3) ## [1] 6 7.2 Lexical Scoping With all these examples of functions, notice that in your global environment, only the function name was added. The function arguments, return values, and all objects defined inside the function are not a part of the global environment. This is not a mistake. We can define objects locally, or temporarily, when using functions. These objects are created and used only when the function is running, and quickly discarded once the function finishes. They never are listed in the global environment. Sometimes you may have an object defined in multiple places. When this happens, R uses a system of rules to determine which definition it will use. In other words, how and where we define an object determines the objects scope, or range of places that we can use this object. The system of rules R uses for searching for objects is called lexical scoping, as opposed to other types of scoping. With this system R looks for objects that are called in a function within the itself, then any enclosing environments, then the global environment, and lastly looking at objects in packages or built-in objects. This is the same searching method that we see in Python and Java. 7.3 Built-In Functions R has functions built-in to it just like excel. You can call these built-in function at any time. We have already seen a few of these functions. c() class() matrix() data.frame() Below are a few more examples using the built-in dataset mtcars, we will use mtcars$mpg as a vector of data to analyze. mean(): Takes in a vector, and returns the mean of the values in the vector. mean(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 20.09062 median(): Takes in a vector, and returns the median of the values in the vector. median(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 19.2 var(): Takes in a vector, and returns the variance of the values in the vector. var(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 36.3241 sqrt(): If you give it a vector, it returns the square root of each element in the vector. If you give it a single number, it returns the square root of the number. sqrt(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 4.582576 4.582576 4.774935 4.626013 4.324350 4.254409 3.781534 4.939636 ## [9] 4.774935 4.381780 4.219005 4.049691 4.159327 3.898718 3.224903 3.224903 ## [17] 3.834058 5.692100 5.513620 5.822371 4.636809 3.937004 3.898718 3.646917 ## [25] 4.381780 5.224940 5.099020 5.513620 3.974921 4.438468 3.872983 4.626013 sd(): Takes in a vector, and returns the standard deviation of the values in the vector. sd(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 6.026948 range(): Takes in a vector, and returns the minimum AND maximum of the values in the vector. range(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 10.4 33.9 quantile(): Takes in a vector as the first argument, and a vector of values between 0 and 1 (any number of values) for the second argument. It will return the corresponding quantiles of the values in the first vector specified by the second vector. To get the \\(10^{th}\\) and \\(90^{th}\\) percentiles: quantile(mtcars$mpg,c(0.10,0.90)) ## 10% 90% ## 14.34 30.09 summary(): You can give this a dataset OR a vector. It returns some summary information about the values in the dataset or vector. summary(cars$speed) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 4.0 12.0 15.0 15.4 19.0 25.0 One of the great advantages of using R is that there is a ton of resources available to learn about it. However, this can also be a disadvantage because of the vast amount of information available. The best and first resource you should look at when trying learn more about R functions is the Help files. 7.4 Help Files The Help files are in R and can be viewed from the lower right window by clicking the Help tab. Here you can search by function name to read about it. Each built in function has a help files, sometimes similar functions are grouped together in the same file. The R Help Files are typically the best resource to get help. The R Help files follow a fairly standard outline. You find most of the following sections in every R Help file: Title: A one-sentence overview of the function. Description: An introduction to the high-level objectives of the function, typically about one paragraph long. Usage: A description of the syntax of the function (in other words, how the function is called). This is where you find all the arguments that you can supply to the function, as well as any default values of these arguments. Arguments: A description of each argument. Usually this includes a specification of the class (for example, character, numeric, list, and so on). This section is an important one to understand, because arguments are frequently a cause of errors in R. Details: Extended details about how the function works, provides longer descriptions of the various ways to call the function (if applicable), and a longer discussion of the arguments. Value: A description of the class of the value returned by the function. See also: Links to other relevant functions. In most of the R editors, you can click these links to read the Help files for these functions. Examples: Worked examples of real R code that you can paste into your console and run. An alternative way to view a functions help file is by typing ? followed by the function name, or by typing help(function_name). # Find a help file for the function `rep` ?rep help(rep) If you are not sure exactly which function you want, you can use ?? followed by what you believe the function name is to look at a list of functions. ??rep 7.5 The … Argument There is a special argument function ... that can be used. Sometimes we call a function within a function that has a different set of arguments. We can use the ... argument as a general placeholder for passing along any additional arguments in a function call. # An example function, uses the ... argument and calls fun2() # ARGUMENTS: x , a numeric vector of length 1 # ..., all additional arguments to be passed to fun2() # RETURNS: z, a numeric vector of length 1 fun1 &lt;- function(x, ...){ y = fun2(...) z = x + y return(z) } # Support function for fun1() # ARGUMENTS: a , a numeric vector of length 1 # RETURNS: b, a numeric vector of length 1 fun2 &lt;- function(a){ b = a^2 return(b) } # Returns 1 + 2^2 = 5 fun1(1, 2) ## [1] 5 We can also use the ... arguement in a nested fashion. # An example function, uses the ... argument and calls fun2() # ARGUMENTS: x , a numeric vector of length 1 # ..., all additional arguments to be passed to fun2() # RETURNS: z, a numeric vector of length 1 fun1 &lt;- function(x, ...){ y = fun2(...) z = x+ y return(z) } # Support function for fun1(), calls fun3() # ARGUMENTS: a , a numeric vector of length 1 # ..., all additional arguments to be passed to fun3() # RETURNS: c, a numeric vector of length 1 fun2 &lt;- function(a, ... ){ b = fun3(...) c = a^2 + b return(c) } # Support function for fun1() and fun2(), called by fun2() # ARGUMENTS: n , a numeric vector of length 1 # RETURNS: n, a numeric vector of length 1 fun3 &lt;- function(n){ n = sqrt(n) return(n) } # Returns: 1 + 2^2 + sqrt(4) = 7 fun1(1, 2, 4) ## [1] 7 # Returns: 1 + 2^2 + sqrt(4) = 7 # Define each input explicitly fun1(x = 1, a = 2, n = 4) ## [1] 7 When using the ... argument it is customary to always place ... at the end of a function argument list, as it can be difficult for R to determine which arguments are to be passed to the next function. If possible, it is good practice to explicitly define the arguments to avoid an error. 7.6 Generic Functions In R we have something called generic functions which are functions that behave differently depending on the class type of one of the arguments. Typically generic functions depend on the class of the first argument. The functions mean(), summary(), and plot() are all generic functions. These functions act as a “middle man” or a “dispatcher”. The generic function calls the actual function you desire. For example, when we call summary() and the first argument is a lm object, then the summary function that is actually run is summary.lm() which may have its own help file.

Control structures help us control how many times code is executed, and when it will be executed. This is helpful because sometime we only want our program to run if certain conditions are met. 8.1 If In R we can also execute commands only if certain conditions are met using the if operator. This feature in R checks a logical value (&lt;value&gt;) and if it is TRUE then a sequence of commands within {} will be ran. If &lt;value&gt; is FALSE, then the commands inside of {} will not be ran. if(&lt;value&gt;){ # Commands } Below we have an example. The code will only be executed if x is a positive number. x = 3 if(x&gt;0){ type = &quot;positive&quot; } type ## [1] &quot;positive&quot; In the example above we have a relational operator which returns a logical value. This logical value was equal to TRUE so the code was executed. 8.2 If Else We can pair an if statement with an else value. After the else object we can define another sequence of commands inside of {}. The else value is paired with the immediate previous if statement. If this if statement is FALSE then the else code will run. If the if statement is TRUE then the else code will not be executed. x = -3 if(class(x) == &quot;numeric&quot;){ type = &quot;number&quot; } else { type = &quot;not a number&quot; } type ## [1] &quot;number&quot; 8.3 Else If Sometimes we will want to do a sequence of checks that are all related, and we will only want code to run if the previous if statements were FALSE and another criteria is TRUE. We can use else if to implement these rules. x = -3 if(x&gt;0){ type = &quot;positive&quot; } else if (x &lt;0) { type = &quot;negative&quot; } else if(x == 0){ type = &quot;zero&quot; } else { type = &quot;Error&quot; } type ## [1] &quot;negative&quot; The command for the if statement will only run if x&gt;0, and the rest of the code will not be implemented. The first else if commands will only execute if the first if statement was FALSE and x&lt;0. The second else if commands will only execute if the previous else if and if statements were FALSE and x==0. If the previous if statement and all previous else if statements are FALSE then the else code will be executed. Here is another example with an if else chain. Toyfun &lt;- function(X,Y,Do){ if(Do == &quot;Add&quot;){ Z = X+Y }else if(Do ==&quot;Subtract&quot;){ Z = X-Y }else if(Do ==&quot;Multiply&quot;){ Z = X*Y }else if(Do ==&quot;Penguin&quot;){ Z = c(&quot;&lt;(&#39;&#39; )&quot;) } else{ Z = c(X,Y) } return(Z) } Toyfun(2,4,&quot;Add&quot;) ## [1] 6 Toyfun(2,4,&quot;Subtract&quot;) ## [1] -2 Toyfun(2,4,&quot;Penguin&quot;) ## [1] &quot;&lt;(&#39;&#39; )&quot; Toyfun(2,4, &quot;Typo&quot;) ## [1] 2 4 8.4 Ifelse We have a shortcut function that can help us keep our code more succinct using the ifelse() function. The first argument of this function is a logical value. the second and third arguments are what to do if the value is TRUE or FALSE, respectively. x &lt;- 3 type &lt;- ifelse(x&gt;0, &quot;positive&quot;, &quot;nonpositive&quot;) type ## [1] &quot;positive&quot; We can also pass ifelse() a vector, and it will check the logical condition for each element of the vector. For example, in the mtcars data set, we can find the proportion of cars have mpg &gt; 25 and hp &gt; 60 fast_efficient &lt;- ifelse(mtcars$mpg &gt; 25 &amp; mtcars$hp&gt;60, TRUE, FALSE) sum(fast_efficient)/length(fast_efficient) ## [1] 0.15625 8.5 Nested If Chains We can make if-else chains nested within each other. x &lt;- 105 if(x&gt;0){ if(x&gt;100){ type = &quot;large positive number&quot; } else { type = &quot;positive number&quot; } } else if(x&lt;0) { type = &quot;negative number&quot; } else if(x==0){ type = &quot;zero&quot; }else { type = &quot;Error&quot; } type ## [1] &quot;large positive number&quot; Additional Resources Chapter 13 of “R for Programming in Data Science” Videos: Control Flow 1 | if Statements Control Flow 2 | if else Statements Control Flow 3 | else if Statements Control Flow 4 | ifelse Function Control Flow 5 | switch Function "],["base-r-plotting.html", "Chapter 9 Base R Plotting 9.1 Load A Big Data Set 9.2 Histograms 9.3 Boxplot 9.4 Scatter Plot 9.5 Pie Charts 9.6 Adding Straight Lines 9.7 Adding Lines Between Points 9.8 Adding Individual Points 9.9 The par() Help File 9.10 Adding Legends 9.11 What makes a good plot?", " Chapter 9 Base R Plotting 9.1 Load A Big Data Set Let use some of the methods above, and others, to analyze a real data set. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United States. As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage. The BRFSS Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss) contains a complete description of the survey, including the research questions that motivate the study and many interesting results derived from the data. We will focus on a random sample of 20,000 people from the BRFSS survey conducted in the year 2000. While there are over 200 variables in this data set, we will work with a smaller subset. We begin by loading the data set of 20,000 observations into the R workspace and examine some of its attributes. source(&quot;http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/cdc.R&quot;) After a brief time, a new data frame cdc appears in the workspace. Each row representing a case (a person surveyed) and each column representing a variable. To get general information on each variable, use the summary() function. summary(cdc) ## genhlth exerany hlthplan smoke100 ## excellent:4657 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 ## very good:6972 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:1.0000 1st Qu.:0.0000 ## good :5675 Median :1.0000 Median :1.0000 Median :0.0000 ## fair :2019 Mean :0.7457 Mean :0.8738 Mean :0.4721 ## poor : 677 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 ## Max. :1.0000 Max. :1.0000 Max. :1.0000 ## height weight wtdesire age gender ## Min. :48.00 Min. : 68.0 Min. : 68.0 Min. :18.00 m: 9569 ## 1st Qu.:64.00 1st Qu.:140.0 1st Qu.:130.0 1st Qu.:31.00 f:10431 ## Median :67.00 Median :165.0 Median :150.0 Median :43.00 ## Mean :67.18 Mean :169.7 Mean :155.1 Mean :45.07 ## 3rd Qu.:70.00 3rd Qu.:190.0 3rd Qu.:175.0 3rd Qu.:57.00 ## Max. :93.00 Max. :500.0 Max. :680.0 Max. :99.00 The variables genhlth and gender are character variables. The summary() command reports the frequencies of the unique values. The variables exerany, hlthplan, and smoke100 are yes/no variables coded as 1=yes or 0=no. They represent the existence or absence or regular exercise, the presence of a healthcare plan, and whether or not the person smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. The means are the proportion of “yes” responses. The variables height, weight, wtdesire, and age are numeric variables. The summary() command gives information on the means, medians, quartiles and range of values. Since this is a very large data set, we wouldn’t want to list all the data. We can use the functions head() and tail() to list the first and last few rows. head(cdc) ## genhlth exerany hlthplan smoke100 height weight wtdesire age gender ## 1 good 0 1 0 70 175 175 77 m ## 2 good 0 1 1 64 125 115 33 f ## 3 good 1 1 1 60 105 105 49 f ## 4 good 1 1 0 66 132 124 42 f ## 5 very good 0 1 0 61 150 130 55 f ## 6 very good 1 1 0 64 114 114 55 f tail(cdc) ## genhlth exerany hlthplan smoke100 height weight wtdesire age gender ## 19995 good 0 1 1 69 224 224 73 m ## 19996 good 1 1 0 66 215 140 23 f ## 19997 excellent 0 1 0 73 200 185 35 m ## 19998 poor 0 1 0 65 216 150 57 f ## 19999 good 1 1 0 67 165 165 81 f ## 20000 good 1 1 1 69 170 165 83 m 9.2 Histograms Histograms are one of the fundamental ways that we can represent a data set. In a histogram we typically have the frequency or proportion on the y-axis, and the x-axis is segmented into mutually exclusive sections. The height of the bins corresponds to amount of observations that fall within a specific range. We can create a histogram using the hist() function. Most of the basic R plots have default settings. For example, the x-axis, y-axis, number of bins, titles, and labels all change depending on the vector supplied into the function. # Look at the help file ?hist hist(cdc$height) hist(cdc$weight) hist(cdc$age) The output appears in the Plots panel of RStudio. You can use the arrows to the left of the Zoom button the switch among the three plots. There are several settings in base R plots that are similar. For example, in base R plots typically we can change the title, x-axis label, and y-axis label with main, xlab, and ylab arguments. hist(cdc$weight, main=&quot;Distribution of Weight&quot;,xlab=&quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) There are also function specific arguments. For example, we can control the number of bins to create. hist(cdc$weight, main=&quot;Distribution of Weight&quot;,xlab=&quot;Weight (kg)&quot;, breaks = 20) Use col argument to change the colors used for the bars. By using the border argument, you can even change the color used for the border of the bars. hist(cdc$weight, breaks=20, main=&quot;Distribution of Weight&quot;, xlab=&quot;Weight (kg)&quot;, border = &quot;mediumpurple4&quot;, col = &quot;mediumpurple1&quot;) There are several ways we can add colors to R. Using Color Names: R programming has names for 657 colors. You can take a look at them all with the colors() function, or simply check this R color pdf. Using Hex Values as Colors: Instead of using a color name, color can also be defined with a hexadecimal value. We define a color as a 6 hexadecimal digit number of the form #RRGGBB. Where the RR is for red, GG for green and BB for blue and value ranges from 00 to FF. For example, #FF0000 would be red and #00FF00 would be green similarly, #FFFFFF would be white and #000000 would be black. Using RGB Values The function rgb() allows us to specify red, green and blue component with a number between 0 and 1. This function returns the corresponding hex code discussed above. Using a Color Palette: R programming offers 5 built in color palettes which can be used to quickly generate color vectors of desired length. They are: rainbow(), heat.colors(), terrain.colors(), topo.colors() and cm.colors(). We pass in the number of colors that we want You can also place values on top of bars; which will help you interpret the graph correctly. You can add them by setting the labels argument to TRUE. hist(cdc$height[1:1000], col=&quot;dodgerblue3&quot;, labels=TRUE, ylim = c(0, 200), breaks = 18) Often you want to compare the distributions of different variables within your data. You can overlay the histograms by setting the add argument of the second histogram to TRUE. # random numbers h1 &lt;- rnorm(1000,6) h2 &lt;- rnorm(1000,4) # Overlay two histograms hist(h1, col=rgb(1,0,0,0.25)) hist(h2, col=rgb(0,0,1,0.25), add=TRUE) For more options, look up “hist” in the Help panel of RStudio. ?hist 9.3 Boxplot Let’s produce a boxplot for the first 1000 values of the height variable. boxplot(cdc$height[1:1000]) The line in the center is the median. The bottom and top of the box are drawn at the first (\\(Q_1\\)) and third (\\(Q_3\\)) quartiles (same as the 25th and 75th percentiles). The difference between the third and first quartiles is called the interquartile range (\\(Q_3-Q_1\\)). This is the height of the box. The lines above and below the box are called the whiskers. The upper whisker is either the third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, \\(Q3 +1.5(Q_3-Q_1)\\), or the largest data value, whichever is smallest. Similarly, the lower whisker is either the first quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range, \\(Q1-1.5(Q_3-Q_1)\\), or the smallest data value, whichever is largest. If data values exceed the whiskers, they are considered outliers (according to the \\(IQR\\) method, see Homework 2) and are plotted as circles. Boxplots are often used to represent numeric data. One can use boxplots to compare different groups using ~ character. On the right side of ~ is the numeric variable, and the left side of ~ is a grouping variable (character, logical, factor). boxplot(cdc$height[1:1000] ~ cdc$gender[1:1000]) 9.4 Scatter Plot We can create a scatter plot using the plot() function in R. This is generic function, which means that it will behave differently depending on the inputted values. For now we will on creating a simple \\(X\\) vs \\(Y\\) plot, which is what we typically want. # Help file for the GENERIC function ?plot ## Help on topic &#39;plot&#39; was found in the following packages: ## ## Package Library ## graphics /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library ## base /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library ## ## ## Using the first match ... # Help file for plot when using a simple X vs Y input ?plot.default # Run the command plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight) Notice that this help file has many of the same arguments as we saw with the hist() function. For example, xlab, ylab, main, and col. A lot of Base R plotting functions are related and use the same techniques and arguments. # Plot using HEX color system plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight, xlab = &quot;Height&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weight&quot;, col = &quot;#33F3FF&quot;) Other interesting features we may want to consider is having different colors points on our plot. We can supple the col argument for a vector the colors we want plotted. If the vector of is the same length as the number of rows in our data set, then the index of the vector of colors corresponds to the index of the point being plotted. If the vector of colors is not the size, then colors are generated using recycling. For example, below only two colors were supplied. This means every other point in the data set had a different color. # Plot using HEX color system plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight, xlab = &quot;Height&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weight&quot;, col = c(&quot;#33F3FF&quot;, &quot;#A833FF&quot;)) There are lots of other features we can change. Consider changing cex, type, bg, pch, ylim, xlim. 9.5 Pie Charts We will now look at some of the qualitative data that are not numbers, but categories or groups. The table() function can be used to tabulate categorical data. The genhlth variable has five categories, we can use table() to find the frequencies. table(cdc$genhlth) ## ## excellent very good good fair poor ## 4657 6972 5675 2019 677 Since the sample size is 20,000, we can divide by n to get proportions. table(cdc$genhlth)/20000 ## ## excellent very good good fair poor ## 0.23285 0.34860 0.28375 0.10095 0.03385 Pie charts are also used for categorical data. Options are also available for the pie() function. pie(table(cdc$genhlth)/20000) Options are also available for the pie() function. colors = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;red&quot;) pie(table(cdc$genhlth)/20000, col = colors, main = &quot;General Health&quot;) 9.6 Adding Straight Lines Often you want to draw attention to specific values or observations in your graphic to provide unique insight. You can do this by adding markers to your graphic. For example, adding mean line will give you an idea about how much of the distribution is above and below the average. You can add such marker by using the abline() function. # Add a line on a histogram hist(cdc$weight, breaks=20, main=&quot;Distribution of Weight&quot;, xlab=&quot;Weight (kg)&quot;, border = &quot;mediumpurple4&quot;, col = &quot;mediumpurple1&quot;) abline(v=mean(cdc$weight), col=&quot;mediumblue&quot;, lty=2, lwd=2) # Add a line on scatter plot plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight, xlab = &quot;Height&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weight&quot;, col = &quot;darkblue&quot;) # Make a solid line abline(h = median(cdc$weight), col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) # Make a dashed line abline(h = median(cdc$wtdesire), col = &quot;red&quot;, lty = 2) 9.7 Adding Lines Between Points Sometimes, we would rather add a line connecting two points, rather than a continuous vertical, horizontal or linear line. To do this we can use the lines() function. # Add a line on scatter plot plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight, xlab = &quot;Height&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weight&quot;, col = &quot;darkblue&quot;) # Add a line connecting two points. lines(x = c(55, 84), y = c(400, 200), col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) # Add a line connecting a series of points lines(x = c(50, 60, 70, 80, 90), y = c(100, 350, 225, 300, 425), col = &quot;green&quot;, lwd = 2) 9.8 Adding Individual Points Similarly we can also add points to any base R graph using the points() function. # Add a line on scatter plot plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight, xlab = &quot;Height&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weight&quot;, col = &quot;darkblue&quot;) # Make a solid line points(mean(cdc$height), mean(cdc$weight), col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16) # Sample random points to plot set.seed(62) random_index = sample(1:nrow(cdc), 20) points(cdc$height[random_index], cdc$weight[random_index], col = &quot;yellow&quot;, pch = 8) In the points() help file we can see a separate section called pch values which contains the different types of points that Base R can create. Notice that the abline() function had arguments lty, and lwd. In addition, the points() function had the arguments cex and bg. The description for these arguments is in the par help file which contains a master set of graphical parameter arguments. In this file we can also see that main, xlab, and ylab are also listed. 9.9 The par() Help File The par file contains graphical arguments that are common in base R graphics functions. We can look inside this help file for even more arguments that may not be listed in the Base R plotting functions like hist(), plot(), points(), and abline(). It is also a function that can adjust global plotting window parameters. For example, suppose we wish to have multiple plots on plotting window. We can control this with mfrow. When adjusting global plotting parameters it is best to always revert back to the default settings when you are done. # Change plot window to have 3 columns and 1 row of plots par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) # Three plots in one window hist(cdc$height) hist(cdc$weight) hist(cdc$age) # Revert back to default par(mfrow = c(1,1)) 9.10 Adding Legends We can also consider adding a legend to our new graph using the legend() function. This function lets us put our own unique labels on different plotting aspects we created. Note that the function arguments like col, lty, and pch are used to dictate what should be on the legend. We control were the legend goes by using the first argument. This first argument x can be the the location on the x-axis, or it can be a keyword such as: “bottomright”, “bottom”, “bottomleft”, “left”, “topleft”, “top”, “topright”, “right” and “center”. # Add a line on a histogram hist(cdc$weight, breaks=20, main=&quot;Distribution of Weight&quot;, xlab=&quot;Weight (kg)&quot;, border = &quot;mediumpurple4&quot;, col = &quot;mediumpurple1&quot;) abline(v=mean(cdc$weight), col=&quot;mediumblue&quot;, lty=2, lwd=2) legend(&quot;topright&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Mean Weight&quot;), lty = 2, col = &quot;mediumblue&quot;, lwd = 2) # Add a line on scatter plot plot(cdc$height, cdc$weight, xlab = &quot;Height&quot;, ylab = &quot;Weight&quot;, col = &quot;darkblue&quot;) # Make a solid line abline(h = median(cdc$weight), col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) # Add a single point points(mean(cdc$height), mean(cdc$weight), col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 16) # Sample random points to plot set.seed(62) random_index = sample(1:nrow(cdc), 20) points(cdc$height[random_index], cdc$weight[random_index], col = &quot;orange&quot;, pch = 8) # Make a legend legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;All Data Values&quot;, &quot;Mean&quot;, &quot;Sample&quot;, &quot;Median Weight&quot;), pch = c(1, 16, 8, NA), col = c(&quot;darkblue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), lty = c(NA, NA, NA, 1)) 9.11 What makes a good plot? It takes practice both to create and identify good plots. In general plots should have the following properties. Informative Title: A title should contain a concise description of what is being plotted. In general, when thinking of a title consider including: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Depending the context and audience you might not need all of these elements. For instance, if you have a standard scatter plot, you do not necessarily need to list “Scatter Plot”. This font should be larger compared to other text on the plot. The title should fit comfortably on the figure. Appropriately Labeled Axis: Use appropriate axis labels. Instead of simply saying “X” or “Y”, say what the variables of these axises are. Include the units of measurement on theses axis labels. Use correct capitalization and punctuation. Make sure the font is reasonably sized. A rule of thumb is for it to be about half the size of the title font. Make sure tick marks and unit intervals on an axis are consistent and appropriate for the scale. Nothing Cutoff: Points, lines, titles, labels, text should all fit comfortably on the plot. There should not be excessive white space, and we should not have values so zoomed in that we cannot see other points. With particularly large data sets we can consider taking a simple random sample, and only plotting those points for ease of readability. Units of measurement listed: Include units of measurement for the different axises, and for additional graphical parameters as necessary. Legends (when applicable): Legends should be included if elements of the plot differ by different variables. Legends can be within the plotting area, or outside of the plotting area. Legends can vary greatly depending on the context. Often times the legend font is smaller than else where on the plot. Communicate a Clear Message: When creating plots it can be tempting to make the plot be too generic or add several elements. Try to have one clear message and objective when creating a plot. Make sure to know your audience. That will also dictate how much you can communicate, and what level of detail needs to be included. This is not an exhaustive list, but contains a general quick check list of items to consider when creating plots. What constituents a “bad” plot and a “good” plot can be subjective. Use your best judgment and be creative. plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, col = factor(iris$Species), pch = as.integer(factor(iris$Species)), main = &quot;Anderson&#39;s Iris Data (1935): Sepal Length vs Petal Length&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sepal Length (cm)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Petal Length (cm)&quot;) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Setosa&quot;, &quot;Versicolor&quot;, &quot;Virginica&quot;), col = c(1, 2, 3), pch = c(1, 2, 3)) "],["packages.html", "Chapter 10 Packages 10.1 Namespace Collisions", " Chapter 10 Packages R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data. They are stored under a directory called “library” in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages during installation. More packages are added later, when they are needed for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, only the default packages are available by default. Other packages which are already installed have to be loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that is going to use them. All the packages available in R language are listed at R Packages. To see a list of all packages installed on your device. library() To see a list of all packages that are currently loaded (note that yours will likely look different). search() ## [1] &quot;.GlobalEnv&quot; &quot;package:knitr&quot; &quot;package:stats&quot; ## [4] &quot;package:graphics&quot; &quot;package:grDevices&quot; &quot;package:utils&quot; ## [7] &quot;package:datasets&quot; &quot;package:methods&quot; &quot;Autoloads&quot; ## [10] &quot;package:base&quot; When adding a new package to our library we only have to install it once. We can do so with the following command. install.packages(&quot;library name&quot;) Alternatively, we can also go to the lower left hand window and select the Packages tab. Then hit the button Install. A dropdown menu will appear where we can search for the package name. Before a package can be used in the code, it must be loaded to the current R environment. You also need to load a package that is already installed previously but not available in the current environment. library(&quot;library name&quot;) For example, suppose we wanted to install and load the package “ggplot2”, (a very popular package for making plots). We would type the following commands. # Install package (only need to do this once) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # Load into working environment (need to do this for each new R session) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) It might seem strange to (1) have to download packages tto use features and (2) have to load these packages each time we wish to use them; however, there are several good reasons for doing packages in this way, and this system is considered a feature. We don’t have all possible packages available to us at all times because that is a lot of information that R would need to store at once which could make our computer lag. These packages are also always being updated at different rates with different features. Most users will only utilize packages in CRAN, so having to update R each session for features you may never use would be tedious. Furthermore, there are several packages which contain objects and functions with the same name. 10.1 Namespace Collisions Every time we load a package into our environment the results for the search() function changes. The most recently added package is always listed after the global environment, followed by the second most recent, and so on. The search() function tells us how R searches for an object that we called. For example, consider the following command. v &lt;- c(1,2,3) mean(v) ## [1] 2 In this case R is searching for the function mean first in the global environment, and then in the package in the order that appears in the output of the search() function. The package base is always last. In our case the function mean() is only defined in the base package. If you want to call a function from a specific package explicitly and want to be sure there is no confusion you can type the package name followed by :: and the desired command. base::mean(v) ## [1] 2 This can be useful, but is not usually necessary. "],["extending-base-r-graphics.html", "Chapter 11 Extending Base R Graphics 11.1 The “maps” Package 11.2 Some additional Packages to consider", " Chapter 11 Extending Base R Graphics Base R Graphics can be greatly extended. There are several packages, functions, and features that we can add to our standard graphics. 11.1 The “maps” Package Base R plotting is very powerful and has many features. However, sometimes you want to create something specialized or create a more unique type of plot. There are a lot of plotting tools that can be added to base R plots by using packages. Packages are covered in more detail in Section 10. We specifically consider the maps package which lets us create different types of maps in R. The most important function in this package is the function map(). This function generates various types of maps depending on the inputted values. If we input nothing, then the function defaults to creating a map of the world with lines dividing the different countries. library(maps) ## Warning: package &#39;maps&#39; was built under R version 4.0.2 map() The first argument for the function map() is called database. This argument is expecting a character vector of length 1. The element in this vector corresponds to the map you want to create. As we saw above, the default for this package is to create a world map, this corresponds to when argument is database= \"world\". The values this argument can support are: “world”, “usa”, “state”, and “county”. par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # world map map(&quot;world&quot;) # USA map map(&quot;usa&quot;) map(&quot;state&quot;) map(&quot;county&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) Within these maps we can specify specific regions that we may want plotted. In general, it supports the names of countries, and states in the US. To specify a region to be plotted we use the region argument, which is the second argument of the function. par(mfrow = c(1,2)) map(&quot;world&quot;, regions = &quot;Switzerland&quot;) map(&quot;state&quot;, regions = &quot;oklahoma&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) These functions have some of the same features of our normal Base R functions. For example, we can still add points and lines to these graphs, but now we have to do it in the correct coordinate system. For example, we can plot the locations of world cities that are capitals using the data set world.cities which is part of the maps package using the base R plot function points(). map(&quot;world&quot;) captial_cities = world.cities[world.cities$capital==1, ] points(captial_cities$long, captial_cities$lat, col = &quot;red&quot;) The maps package does not use the standard base R label arguments like main, xlab, ylab. However, if we wish to have a map with labels we can use the function map.text() instead of map(). This is essentially the same function as map(), but it defaults to labeling the graph for us. If we want to add our own custom label we use the labels argument. par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # Default Label map.text(&quot;world&quot;, regions = &quot;Switzerland&quot;) # Custom Label map.text(&quot;state&quot;, regions = &quot;oklahoma&quot;, labels = &quot;Custom Label Here&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) 11.2 Some additional Packages to consider Extend Fonts and Colors showtext: Extend the fonts of R emojis: Add emojis to plots. viridis: Color palettes for common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. RColorBrewer: Color palettes particularly common for maps. wesanderson: Color palettes generated mostly from ‘Wes Anderson’ movies. More Plot Formats corrplot: Provides a visual exploratory tool on correlation matrix that supports automatic variable reordering to help detect hidden patterns among variables. heatmp: Create heat maps. riverplot: Implements Sankey or Ribbon plots. sinaplot: Creates enhanced jitter strip chart, where the width of the jitter is controlled by the density distribution of the data within each class. vcd: Visualization techniques, data sets, summary and inference procedures aimed particularly at categorical data. visreg: If you know about linear regression, you can use this make advanced linear regression plots. vioplot: Creates violin plots which are a combination of a box plot and a density plot (density plots look kinda like histograms).

They dictate how many times a series of commands should be run. There are two type of loops, a while loop and a for loop. These two loops operate similarly and are found in other programming languages such as C and Python. 12.1 While Loop A while loop is used when you want to perform a task indefinitely, until a particular condition is met. It’s a condition-controlled loop. The loop will continue until the condition is FALSE. x = 5 # If statement is true, keep running the loop while (x != 0 ) { print(x) x = x - 1 } ## [1] 5 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 1 If the condition is false at the start, the while loop will never be executed at all. x = 0 # If statement starts as TRUE, the loop will never run while (x != 0 ) { print(x) x = x - 1 } 12.2 For Loops The for statement in R is a bit different from what you usually use in other programming languages. Rather than iterating over a numeric progression, R’s for statement iterates over the items of a vector or a list. The items are iterated in the order that they appear in the vector. # Iterate through a vector colors &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;) for (x in colors) { print(x) } ## [1] &quot;red&quot; ## [1] &quot;green&quot; ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; ## [1] &quot;yellow&quot; lst &lt;- list(3.14, &quot;Hi&quot;, c(1,2,3)) for (i in lst) { print(i) } ## [1] 3.14 ## [1] &quot;Hi&quot; ## [1] 1 2 3 If you need to execute a group of statements for a specified number of times, use sequence operator : or built-in function seq(). # Print &#39;Hello!&#39; 3 times for (x in 1:3) { print(&quot;Hello!&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;Hello!&quot; ## [1] &quot;Hello!&quot; ## [1] &quot;Hello!&quot; for (x in seq(from=2,to=8,by=2)) { print(x^2) } ## [1] 4 ## [1] 16 ## [1] 36 ## [1] 64 12.3 Break The break statement is used to exit the loop immediately. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop. x &lt;- 5 # If statement starts as TRUE, the loop will never run while (x != 0 ) { print(x) x = x - 1 if(x == 2){ print(&quot;Entered IF statement, stop loop&quot;) break } } ## [1] 5 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 3 ## [1] &quot;Entered IF statement, stop loop&quot; If not given an adequate stopping criteria or break statement the loop will continue forever. For example, if we started the above examples at x = -2. The break statement is particularly important for the while loop. The break statement can also be used in a for loop. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop. colors &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;) for (x in colors) { if (x == &quot;blue&quot;){ break } print(x) } ## [1] &quot;red&quot; ## [1] &quot;green&quot; The for loops do not have the same risk of “running forever”, like while loops have. 12.4 Next We can also use the next command in both for loops and while loops in order to skip executing a command. for(i in 1:10){ i &lt;- i^2 if(i &lt;5){ next } print(i) } ## [1] 9 ## [1] 16 ## [1] 25 ## [1] 36 ## [1] 49 ## [1] 64 ## [1] 81 ## [1] 100 The code inside the loop will run until it reaches the next statement. Once 12.5 Nested Loops We can also create loops within loops. We refer to creating loops within other loops as a nested loop. for(i in 1:10){ for(j in 1:3){ statement = paste(&quot;i=&quot;, i, &quot;, j=&quot;, j) print(statement) } } ## [1] &quot;i= 1 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 1 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 1 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 2 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 2 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 2 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 3 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 3 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 3 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 4 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 4 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 4 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 5 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 5 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 5 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 6 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 6 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 6 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 7 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 7 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 7 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 8 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 8 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 8 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 9 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 9 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 9 , j= 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 10 , j= 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 10 , j= 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;i= 10 , j= 3&quot; Here is an example of a nested loop which changes the elements of matrix to be the product of the row and column location. my_matrix &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = 5, ncol = 5) for(i in 1:nrow(my_matrix)){ for(j in 1:nrow(my_matrix)){ my_matrix[i,j] = i*j } } my_matrix ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 8 10 ## [3,] 3 6 9 12 15 ## [4,] 4 8 12 16 20 ## [5,] 5 10 15 20 25 12.6 Examples A few more examples. 12.6.1 Example 1 Below we create a function that has only one argument, vec, an arbitrary numeric vector. This function create a new vector containing all elements in vec whole numbers, and returns this new vector. If there are no whole numbers in vec, then it returns NA. # Create a subset of x which only contains whole numbers # ARGUMENTS: vec, a numeric vector # RETURNS: whole_vec, a vector containing all whole numbers # will equal NA if there are no whole numbers whole_num &lt;- function(vec){ # Initialize whole_vec whole_vec &lt;-NULL # For loop, go through each element in vec for(i in vec){ if( i == round(i)){ whole_vec &lt;- c(whole_vec, i) } } # Check to make sure there was at least one whole number if(length(whole_vec)==0){ whole_vec = NA } return(whole_vec) } # Test case tester &lt;- c(1, 3, 5.5, 10.8, pi, 62) whole_num(tester) # Should return 1, 3, 62 ## [1] 1 3 62 12.6.2 Example 2 Below we create a function that has only one argument, bound, a numeric object of length one. This function returns the minimum number of subsequent whole numbers (starting from 1) that must be added together in order to reach (or surpass) bound. For example, suppose bound=16. Then 1+2+3+4+5 = 15, and 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21. Thus, the function would return 6. get_num &lt;- function(bound = 16){ # Initialize values total &lt;- 0 i &lt;- 0 # Use while loop to reach bound while(total &lt;= bound){ i &lt;- i + 1 total &lt;- total + i } return(i) } get_num(15) ## [1] 6 12.7 Additional Resources Chapter 13 of “R for Programming in Data Science” Videos: Control Flow 6 | while loops Control Flow 7 | while loops Bisection Method Control Flow 8 | infinite while loops Control Flow 9 | for loop Intro Control Flow 10 | break and next Control Flow 11 | nested for loops Programming Loops vs. Recursion - Computerphile "],["apply.html", "Chapter 13 Apply Family of Functions 13.1 apply() 13.2 lapply() 13.3 sapply() 13.4 tapply() 13.5 mapply() 13.6 replicate() 13.7 How to Pick a Method 13.8 More Examples Additional Resources", " Chapter 13 Apply Family of Functions Loops (like for, and while) are a way to repeatedly execute some code. However, they are often slow in execution when it comes to processing large data sets. R has a more efficient and quick approach to perform iterations – The apply family. The apply family consists of vectorized functions. Below are the most common forms of apply functions. apply() lapply() sapply() tapply() mapply() replicate() These functions let you take data in batches and process the whole batch at once. There primary difference is in the object (such as list, matrix, data frame etc.) on which the function is applied to and the object that will be returned from the function. These functions apply a function to different components of a vector/list/dataframe/array in a non-sequential way. In general, if each element in your object is not dependent on the other elements of your object then an apply function is usually faster than a loop. 13.1 apply() The apply()function is used to apply a function to the rows or columns of arrays (matrices). It assembles the returned values, and then returns it in a vector, array, or list. If you want to apply a function on a data frame, make sure that the data frame is homogeneous (i.e. either all numeric values or all character strings). Otherwise, R will force all columns to have identical types using as.matrix(). This may not be what you want. In that case, you might consider using the lapply() or sapply() functions instead. Description of the required apply() arguments: X: A array (or matrix) MARGIN: A vector giving the subscripts which the function will be applied over. 1 indicates rows 2 indicates columns c(1, 2) indicates rows and columns FUN: The function to be applied ...: Additional arguments to be passed to “FUN” Example: Built In Function # Get column means data &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol=3) data ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 apply(data, 2, mean) ## [1] 2 5 8 # Get row means apply(data, 1, sum) ## [1] 12 15 18 Example: User Defined Function You can use user-defined functions as well. apply(data, 2, function(x){ # Standard deviation formula y &lt;- sum(x -mean(x))^2/(length(x)-1) return(y) }) ## [1] 0 0 0 13.1.1 Returned Objects The values that apply() returns depends on the function FUN. If FUN returns an element of length 1, then apply() will return a vector. If FUN always returns an element of length n&gt;1, then apply() will return a matrix with n rows, and the number of columns will correspond to how many rows/columns were iterated over. Lastly, if FUN returns an object that would vary in length, then apply() will return a list where each element corresponds to a row or column that was iterated over. In short, apply() prioritizes returning a vector, array (or matrix), and list (in that order). What is returned depends on the output of FUN. 13.1.2 Example: Extra Arguments, Array Output x &lt;- cbind(x1 = 3, x2 = c(4:1, 2:5)) fun1 &lt;- function(x, c1, c2){ mean_vec &lt;- c(mean(x[c1]), mean(x[c2])) return(mean_vec) } apply(x, 1, fun1, c1 = &quot;x1&quot;, c2 = c(&quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] 3.0 3 3.0 3 3.0 3 3.0 3 ## [2,] 3.5 3 2.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 13.1.3 Example: List Output mat &lt;- matrix(c(-1, 1, 0, 2, -2, 20, 62,-2, -6), nrow = 3) CheckPos &lt;- function(Vec){ # Subset values of Vec that are even PosVec &lt;- Vec[Vec &gt; 0] # Return only the even values return(PosVec) } # Check Positive values by column apply(mat, 2, CheckPos) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 20 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 62 13.2 lapply() The lapply() function is used to apply a function to each element of the list. It collects the returned values into a list, and then returns that list which is of the same length. Description of the required lapply() arguments: X: A list FUN: The function to be applied ...: Additional arguments to be passed to FUN data_lst &lt;- list(item1 = 1:5, item2 = seq(4,36,8), item3 = c(1,3,5,7,9)) data_lst ## $item1 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $item2 ## [1] 4 12 20 28 36 ## ## $item3 ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 data_vector &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) data_vector ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 lapply(data_lst, sum) ## $item1 ## [1] 15 ## ## $item2 ## [1] 100 ## ## $item3 ## [1] 25 lapply(data_vector, sum) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 4 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 5 ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 6 ## ## [[7]] ## [1] 7 ## ## [[8]] ## [1] 8 x &lt;- list(a = 1:10, beta = exp(-3:3), logic = c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE)) # compute the list mean for each list element lapply(x, mean) ## $a ## [1] 5.5 ## ## $beta ## [1] 4.535125 ## ## $logic ## [1] 0.5 Unlike apply(), lapply() will always return a list. If the argument X is an object that is something other than a list then the as.list() function will be used to convert that object. Consider the built-in data set iris in R. If we use the as.list() function, each column will be converted into an element of a list. head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa str(as.list(iris)) ## List of 5 ## $ Sepal.Length: num [1:150] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num [1:150] 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num [1:150] 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num [1:150] 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

The only difference is that lapply() always returns a list, whereas sapply() tries to simplify the result into a vector or matrix. The output for sapply() is just like the output of apply(), it depends on the dimensions of the returned value for FUN. If the return value is a list where every element is length 1, you get a vector. If the return value is a list where every element is a vector of the same length (&gt; 1), you get a matrix. If the lengths vary, simplification is impossible and you get a list. Description of the required sapply() arguments: X: A list FUN: The function to be applied data_lst &lt;- list(item1 = 1:5, item2 = seq(4,36,8), item3 = c(1,3,5,7,9)) data_lst ## $item1 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $item2 ## [1] 4 12 20 28 36 ## ## $item3 ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 sapply(data_lst, sum) ## item1 item2 item3 ## 15 100 25 13.4 tapply() The tapply() function breaks the data set up into groups and applies a function to each group. Description of the required sapply() arguments: X: A 1 dimensional object INDEX: A grouping factor or a list of factors FUN: The function to be applied data &lt;- data.frame(name=c(&quot;Amy&quot;,&quot;Max&quot;,&quot;Ray&quot;,&quot;Kim&quot;,&quot;Sam&quot;,&quot;Eve&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;), age=c(24, 22, 21, 23, 20, 24, 21), gender=factor(c(&quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;,&quot;M&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;))) data ## name age gender ## 1 Amy 24 F ## 2 Max 22 M ## 3 Ray 21 M ## 4 Kim 23 F ## 5 Sam 20 M ## 6 Eve 24 F ## 7 Bob 21 M tapply(data$age, data$gender, min) ## F M ## 23 20 13.5 mapply() The mapply() function is a multivariate version of sapply(). It applies FUN to the first elements of each … argument, the second elements, the third elements, and so on. Description of the required mapply() arguments: FUN: The function to be applied ...: Arguments to vectorize over (vectors or lists of strictly positive length, or all of zero length). mapply(rep, times = 1:4, x = 4:1) ## [[1]] ## [1] 4 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 3 3 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 2 2 2 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 1 1 1 1 13.6 replicate() The replicate() function is a wrapper for sapply(). If we want to repeat an evaluation of an function call or an expression that does not require us to iterate through a data set or vector we can use replicate(). Description of the required replicate() arguments: n: An integer containing the number of replications. expr: The expression (or function call) to evaluate repeatedly. replicate(n = 4, &quot;Hello&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;Hello&quot; replicate(n = 10, factorial(4)) ## [1] 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 replicate(n = 5, sample(c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; ## [2,] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; 13.7 How to Pick a Method It can be difficult at first to decide which of these apply function you may want to use. In general, we can use the flow chart below as a quick guide. 13.8 More Examples To see some more examples of these functions in action. We will use the iris data set which is a built in data set in R. This data set has four numeric columns, and one factor column, Species.

The are commonly used in a variety of applications and fields. Often times we have a particular theory or an idea about how things work. In order to verify that our theory is correct we can simulate a data set with known properties, and then check if the data set matches our theory. For example, suppose you want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the heights of all college students. Our theory on confidence intervals says that we expect that a 95% confidence interval will capture the true mean about 95% of the time. If we simply go out and take a sample of data from “real-life” and then calculate the a confidence interval we have no idea if that confidence interval captures the truth because the true average height of all college students is unknown! It is not feasible to sample every college students, so we will never know if the true mean actually falls within our interval. Furthermore, in this example we only calculated one confidence interval. If we did know the true mean then our results would simply indicate that the confidence interval captured the mean or not, but nothing about the rate that confidence intervals capture the mean, which should be 95%. What we can do instead is simulate this process. We can randomly generate data that has a true mean of \\(\\mu\\) using a computer. Then we can estimate a 95% confidence interval using the appropriate methods and see if this confidence interval contains \\(\\mu\\). We then can repeat this process as many times as we would like because we are using a computer, which makes the process much simpler. If our theory about confidence intervals is correct we would expect that 95% of our confidence intervals captured the true mean (\\(\\mu\\)), and the rest did not. Simulations are very important, and can range greatly in complexity. We will focus on simple techniques in this section. For a more complete discussion on simulation studies in statistics, and best practices see this freely available online at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.8086. 14.2 Review Random Variables Before discussing how to simulate data with specific properties we review the concept of a random variable. This discussion is adapted primarily from Chapter 3 and 4 of Diez, Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr (2020). A random variable is a random process or variable with a numeric outcome. Random variables in general have a typical value which is called the expected value. However, in practice random variables also have variability, that is we do not expect to obtain the expected value for every random variable. Instead we expect to observe a range of values according to some sort of pattern, which is usually centered around the expected value. For example, in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming there is a famous geyser called Old Faithful. A geyser is a natural hot spring that periodically erupts water. The amount of time (in minutes) the eruption lasts varies each time, but not by a dramatic amount. The eruption time in minutes is the random variable, and the expected value is the average eruption length, and we can measure the variability using a measure of dispersion, like the variance. Below is a histogram of a random sample of eruptions times of 272 different eruptions. hist(faithful$eruptions, main = &quot;Eruption Times of Old Faithful&quot;, xlab = &quot;Time (in minutes)&quot;, breaks = seq(0, 7, by = .5)) As mentioned previously, random variables generate observations according to some sort of pattern. These patterns are referred to as densities, and can be analyzed visually, and analytically (i.e. through formulas). One of the most common ways to look at how often we would expect certain values for data that we find from the “real-world” is to use a histogram. Histogram order observations into mutually exclusive bins, where the height of each bin indicates how common a particular range of values is. For example, in the histogram above each bin is a 30 second (0.5 minute) range, and we can see the frequency of observations within the data set that are in this range on the y-axis. When thinking about random variables though, it is often more helpful to look at the proportion of observed values within a bin, instead of the frequency. We can modify our histogram to accomplish this. hist(faithful$eruptions, main = &quot;Eruption Times of Old Faithful&quot;, xlab = &quot;Time (in minutes)&quot;, breaks = seq(0, 7, by = .5), freq = FALSE) Notice that the y-axis now says “Density”. This is the relative probability that an observed data point will be a particular value. In “real-world” data, we can only estimate the density. We will never know the truth. Hence, we will never know the true expected value, or the true variance. This is why we have statistics!! We have statistics in order to make educated guesses about these values and properties from which the data arises from. Analyzing the density or pattern of a random variable visually with histograms is intuitive, but limiting. Using a formula as a representation for a density is much more versatile and useful. For these functions we have parameters which are values that let us further customize the function representation of a density to the specific random variable that we have. Let \\(X\\) be a random variable, and \\(x\\) be some observed value. In practice, if \\(X\\) is a random variable that can only take on values that are discrete (usually integers) then we say the probability of observing some a particular value, say \\(x\\), is denoted \\(p(x)\\). There are extremely well known discrete densities that random variables tend to follow and that are available in R. A few of them are listed below. Binomial: \\[p(x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \\hspace{1cm} x = 0, ..., n\\] Poison: \\[p(x) = λ^x exp(-λ)/x! \\hspace{1cm} x = 0, ..., n\\] Negative Binomial: \\[Γ(x+n)/(Γ(n) x!) p^n (1-p)^x \\hspace{1cm} x = 0, ..., \\] If \\(X\\) is a random variable that can be any value within a range of numbers then we denote the density function of this random variable by \\(f(x)\\). As with discrete random variables, there are extremely well known continuous densities that random variables tend to follow and that are available in R. A few of them are listed below. Uniform: \\[f(x) = 1/(max-min)\\] Log-Normal: \\[f(x) = 1/(√(2 π) σ x) e^{-((log{(x)} - μ)^2 / (2 σ^2))} \\hspace{1cm} 0 &lt;x &lt; \\infty\\] Exponential: \\[f(x) = λ {e}^{- λ x} \\hspace{1cm} 0 &lt;x &lt; \\infty\\] Normal: \\[f(x) = 1/(√(2 π) σ) e^{-((x - μ)^2/(2 σ^2))} \\hspace{1cm} -\\infty &lt;x &lt; \\infty\\] t-Distribution \\[f(x) = Γ((n+1)/2) / (√(n π) Γ(n/2)) (1 + x^2/n)^-((n+1)/2)\\hspace{1cm} -\\infty &lt;x &lt; \\infty\\] To see a complete list of well known distribution functions (or densities) that R already has see the help file ?Distributions. 14.3 Generating Random Variables Each distribution available in base R is listed in ?Distributions. Each of the distributions has a link to their corresponding help file which lists four main functions: dxxx(), pxxx(), qxxx() and rxxx(). These are the density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function, and a random number generator for the particular random variable of interest. The letters xxx are replaced by an code for the particular random variable. The density function (dxxx()) generates the relative probability of observing a particular value. The cumulative distribution function (pxxx()) generates the probability of observing a particular value, and anything smaller than this value. The quantile function (qxxx()) generates what value corresponds to a given percentile. Lastly, the random number generator (rxxx()) will generate a random variable according to the given distribuiton/density. We will focus only on dxxx() and rxxx(). For example, go to ?Distributions and click on dnorm which corresponds to the normal distribution (in the bottom third of the list). Here you will see the functions dnorm(), pnorm(), qnorm(), and rnorm(). To generate a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 we can use the following command. # Generate a single normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 rnorm(1) ## [1] -0.1049144 # Generate 20 normal random variables with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 rnorm(20) ## [1] -1.392449727 1.018245804 0.826401081 1.289595050 -0.643231482 ## [6] -0.001173311 -1.948468606 0.680949495 0.274233523 -1.905682922 ## [11] -1.207395634 0.379645715 -0.832700980 -1.480467865 1.045205002 ## [16] 1.203374466 1.143497941 -0.798450844 0.713542224 0.014509402 However, as we saw in the previous section, these common distribution functions have parameters which let us further customize the behavior of the random variable. We can change the parameters of any of the distributions in R using the function arguments. # Normal random variable with mean 10, and standard deviation 0.5 rnorm(1, mean = 10, sd = 0.5) ## [1] 10.53266 # Normal random variable with mean 10, and standard deviation 0.5 rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 0.5) ## [1] 9.918810 9.633491 10.141749 9.903283 10.774333 10.138772 9.615449 ## [8] 10.785818 10.650341 10.024944 9.791361 10.094124 10.505912 10.409901 ## [15] 10.263248 9.263302 9.656979 9.812624 10.574604 10.154701 To find the relative probability of observing a particular value for a normal distribution we use dnorm(). # Relative probability of observing the value 0.25 # for a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard devation 1 dnorm(0.25) ## [1] 0.3866681 # Relative probability of observing the value 0.25, -0.5, 2 # for a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard devation 1 dnorm(c(0.25, -0.5, 2)) ## [1] 0.38666812 0.35206533 0.05399097 14.4 Setting a Seed Often times when running a simulation we will want to use the same numbers over and over again. The function rxxx() generates values randomly though, which means each time we call this function we will get new and different values. In order to make sure our values are consistent each time we run R, or across computers we can set the seed. The seed determines the way the computer generates our random numbers. Normally the seed is random, so each time rxxx() is called we get a new random sequence. Using the set.seed() function will make sure that the sequence stays the same each time we run rxxx(). See the example below were generate a sequence of 10 uniform random variables that are between -5 and 5. If you copy this code directly into your computer you will get the same sequence. However, if you do not set the seed you will get a different sequence. set.seed(1) runif(10, min = -5, max = 5) ## [1] -2.3449134 -1.2787610 0.7285336 4.0820779 -2.9831807 3.9838968 ## [7] 4.4467527 1.6079779 1.2911404 -4.3821373 14.5 sample() The sample() function is a powerful tool that can let you create your own unique random sequence. You can sample values with replacement, or without replacement. You can also assign certain probabilities to certain events. This is a particularly helpful function for rearranging rows, and for generating a sequence of categorical variables. For example, we can simulate a coin flip. sample(c(&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;), size=1 , prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; Below is the code for simulating 10 coin flips. sample(c(&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;), size=10 , prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; ## [10] &quot;Heads&quot; We can set the seed like we did before in order to insure we keep getting the same sample each time we run this code. set.seed(1) sample(c(&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;), size=10 , prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; ## [10] &quot;Tails&quot; 14.6 replicate() The replicate() function repeats a function call n times in a very efficient way. Suppose we wish to find the probability we get exactly 3 heads if we flip a coin 10 times. We can replicate flipping a coin 10 times, and count how many of these times we see exactly 3 heads. coin_flip_heads3 &lt;- function(){ coin_flip &lt;- sample(c(&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;), size=10 , prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE) num_heads &lt;- length(which(coin_flip == &quot;Heads&quot;)) if(num_heads == 3){ heads3 = TRUE } else{ heads3 = FALSE } return(heads3) } # Generates flipping a coin 3 times # Returns TRUE if exactly 3 flips resulted in heads # Returns FALSE if otherwise coin_flip_heads3() ## [1] FALSE # Replicate the experiment 10,000 times see_heads3 &lt;- replicate(10000, coin_flip_heads3()) # How many of these experiments results in 3 heads??? # Probability of seeing exactly 3 heads is approximately 12% table(see_heads3)/10000 ## see_heads3 ## FALSE TRUE ## 0.8861 0.1139 14.7 Adding curves to graphs Often times when generating data or using a real-world data set we might want to see how well a well known distribution fits a particular data set. We can do so by adding the proposed density function on to a histogram which contains the data set of interest. For example, suppose we wish to see if a normal distribution with mean of 3.5 and standard deviation of 1.14 fits the old faithful data set for eruption times. We can add this density function on top and see if it approximately fits the data. hist(faithful$eruptions, main = &quot;Eruption Times of Old Faithful&quot;, xlab = &quot;Time (in minutes)&quot;, breaks = seq(0, 7, by = .5), freq = FALSE) curve(dnorm(x, 3.5, 1.14), add = TRUE) Now lets generate 272 normal random variables with mean 3.5 and standard deviation of 1.14 and see how well are generated data matches the density function. gen_data &lt;- rnorm(272, mean = 3.5, sd = 1.14) hist(gen_data, main = &quot;Simulated Data&quot;, xlab = &quot;X&quot;, breaks = seq(-0.5, 7, by = .5), freq = FALSE) curve(dnorm(x, 3.5, 1.14), add = TRUE) We do not see a perfect fit, but this is what happens with random samples. The fit for the simulated data is what we expect approximately if we had a sample with this distribution. It should be approximately the same as the curve, which we see for the simulated data. Our old faithful data is significantly less fitted the simulated data. Thus it appears that the old faithful eruption times is probably not normally distributed with mean 3.5 and standard deviation 1.14. How similar is “similar enough” is not a hard and fast rule, and it is ultimately up to the researcher. The simulated data set gives us a general idea of what is “similar enough”. Note that the curve() function does not need to be added to graph but can stand alone. curve(dnorm(x, 3.5, 1.14), 0, 7, add = FALSE) In addition, we can make our own functions to plot using curve(). my_fun &lt;- function(x){ y = x^2 + 2*x - 3 return(y) } curve(my_fun(x), -10, 10) 14.8 Example: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) 14.8.1 Recall CLT Let \\(X_1, ..., X_n\\) be independent and identically distributed random variables with mean and variance, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). If the sample size is sufficiently large (\\(n \\geq 30\\)), the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) will tend to follow a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). In other words, for any set of data \\(X_1, ..., X_n\\) that is independent and comes from the same distribution, and that distribution has a finite mean and variance, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). Then \\[\\bar{x} \\sim N \\left ( \\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right ) \\] The distribution above is a sampling distribution. It is the distribution of a sample mean. That is, if we take \\(k\\) samples, and for each sample we calculated the mean, the central limit theorem tells us about the distribution of these means (\\(\\bar{x}_1, \\dots, \\bar{x}_k\\)). 14.8.2 Assumption Violations of CLT The central limit theorem has a few key assumptions. Some of these assumptions are fairly easy to meet, and others are more susceptible to being violated. For example, typically it is reasonable to assume that mean and variance are finite. Other assumptions are easier to violate, and the consequences of violating these assumptions vary greatly. Sometimes we may have data that comes from a mix of multiple distributions, this violate the assumption that data is identically distributed. Another assumption violation could be independence. For example, in time series data we typically observe a random variable over a sequence of time and measure it repeatedly. This would violate the independence assumption because earlier observations are typically related to future observations. Another assumption that is often violated is the minimum sample size. The central limit theorem says we need at least 30 observations, or else we should use the t-distribution instead. Historically this is usually not a very big problem. The requirement that our sample size is at least 30 is a “rule of thumb” and not based on rigorous statistical theory. Below are a summary of these assumptions restated: All our observations are independent, and have the same distribution (come from same population) Sample size is greater than 30 (\\(n\\geq 30\\)) The mean and the variance of the distribution the data comes from are finite (\\(|\\mu|&lt; \\infty, |\\sigma^2|&lt; \\infty\\)) Once we have verified these assumptions, we still need to determine what the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) are. If we know that our distribution is one of the really common ones above, then this task becomes much eaiser. 14.8.3 The Data We will see how well the CLT theorem applies to a data set that has a uniform distribution. That is, say we have a sample of 50 observations which we believe are all uniformly distributed between -5 and 5. We want to determine if the mean of a sample of this type would be normally distributed according to the CLT. To do so, we simulate a sample of this type 10,000 times and assess if it matches the CLT results. # Simulate a sample of 50 observations that are uniformly distributed gen_unif_mean = function(the_min, the_max){ gen_data = runif(50, the_min, the_max) the_mean = mean(gen_data) the_parameters = c(the_min, the_max) results = list(the_mean, the_parameters) names(results) = c(&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;parameters&quot;) return(results) } # Simulate 10000 samples, each of size 50, where the minumum value is -5 # And the maximum value is 5 set.seed(123) sim_means &lt;- replicate(10000, gen_unif_mean(the_min = -5, the_max=5)$mean) # histogram of results hist(sim_means, freq = FALSE) To add a curve to the graph we need to know the mean and the standard deviation of the data we generated. For a uniform distribution with a minimum of -5 and a maximum of 5, the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is \\(10/\\sqrt{12} \\approx 2.89\\). Thus according to CLT, we expect our histogram above to correspond to a normal density with mean 0 and standard deviation \\(2.89/\\sqrt{50} \\approx 0.41\\). # histogram of results hist(sim_means, freq = FALSE) # Add normal curve according to CLT curve(dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 0.41), add = TRUE) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
